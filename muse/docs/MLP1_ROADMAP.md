## Summary

Mythos evolves into a **Project Knowledge System** with an AI co-author layer:
- Role-agnostic templates (Writer is one) for domain specialization
- Auto-extraction of entities, relationships, project context (Project Graph)
- Writer style adaptation via embeddings
- Real-time feedback (show-don't-tell, dialogue, tension)
- Tool-based workspace manipulation
- Thread persistence with full context
- Offline-first + real-time sync (Figma model)
- **Focus Mode** — distraction-free writing, AI silent unless invoked
- **Sortiermaschine** — auto-organize entities, relationships, project context (Project Graph)

## Templates (Project Knowledge System)

- Templates define default registry types, document kinds, and capability sets.
- Registry overrides remain per-project (template provides the base; projects can diverge).
- No schema churn required: types, properties, and metadata are validated against the resolved registry.

## Supabase → Convex Migration (MLP1)

All Supabase → Convex migration work is complete.
Reference: `../DB_MIGRATION_REPORT.md`.


### Recent Updates (2026-01-11)

- AI-generated Project Graph templates (no standard template list); registry resolution keyed by `project.templateId`.
- Projects/documents now support `templateId`, `metadata`, and `settings` (template IDs reference AI-generated templates); org/team schema scaffolding added for enterprise access control.
- Project Graph approvals now driven by registry `riskLevel` + per-type identity fields (legacy writer fields still optional).
- AI task routing expanded with `review`/`generation` plus product/engineering/design/comms task slugs; `coach`/`creative` aliased.
- UI updates: registry lock/unlock controls added in settings; entity create/edit now supports schema-driven properties.
- UI gaps: no AI template generation flow yet, no org/team management UI, no registry editor UI; Project Graph filters are registry-driven but template icon/color coverage is incomplete for non-writer templates; schema-driven property/relationship metadata editors are still missing; universal entity profile page (overview/graph/mentions/documents/history) not yet implemented.
- Phase 3 MCP Citations Integration: citations schema added to mutating tools; memories/citations resources discoverable via `saga://projects/{id}/memories` and `saga://projects/{id}/citations`; proposal-first routing for governed tool calls (`muse/packages/mcp-server/src/tools.ts`, `muse/packages/mcp-server/src/resources.ts`, `muse/packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts`).
- Phase 4 Clarity/Policy Coach fully implemented (see 2026-01-10 notes for details).

    - E2E test IDs per contract: `coach-issue-*`, `clarity-issue-*`, `policy-issue-*`, `coach-apply-fix-*`, `coach-pin-policy-*`, `coach-jump-canon-*`

### UI Integration (Design Checklist)

**Phase 1: Project Graph**
- Project settings: type registry editor (`projectTypeRegistry`) for entity/relationship types, risk levels, and optional JSON schema.
- Graph UI: generic node/edge create/edit that supports `type: string` + `properties`, with schema-driven forms when available. (Entity form done; relationship metadata editor pending.)
- Approvals UX: surface risk level + approval requirement at the point of change.
- Universal entity profile page: overview + graph + mentions + documents + history (spec in `docs/UNIVERSAL_ENTITY_PROFILE.md`).

### Phase 1: Project Graph UX (Expo Web + Tauri v2) — Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Editable Project Graph with registry-enforced validation and risk-aware approvals, running in Expo Web and shipped via Tauri v2.

#### Graph UX (CRUD)
- [ ] Add “Open Project Graph” secondary UI path in editor (`data-testid="editor-open-project-graph"`)
- [ ] Graph: create entity (button/FAB → EntityFormModal)
- [ ] Graph: create relationship (connect nodes → RelationshipFormModal)
- [ ] Graph: edit relationship (edge click → RelationshipFormModal)
- [ ] (Optional but recommended) Graph: delete entity/relationship with confirmation

#### Schema-driven editors
- [ ] Extract reusable JSON Schema object editor component (supports enum, string, number/int, boolean, array<string>, raw JSON fallback)
- [ ] Relationship metadata editor (schema-driven + raw JSON fallback)

#### Registry-driven UI (template-safe)
- [ ] EntityFormModal type selector driven by resolved registry (not WRITER_ENTITY_TYPES)
- [ ] Fill icon/color defaults for non-writer templates (product/engineering/design/comms)
- [ ] Add relationship filters and “focus mode” (depth-based neighborhood)

#### Validation + error contract
- [ ] Ensure entity/relationship mutations validate type + schema (AJV reject-only) and return Graph API error codes
- [ ] Client-side Convex error parser that surfaces `INVALID_TYPE`, `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_FAILED`, `REGISTRY_LOCKED`, etc.

#### Approvals (AI graph writes)
- [ ] Persist approval preview payloads for create/update entity/relationship tool calls
- [ ] Approvals UI supports entity/relationship diffs + risk rationale + approve/reject
- [ ] Applying an approval executes the tool, updates graph state, and logs activity

#### Expo Web + Tauri v2 integration
- [ ] Port or package Project Graph for Expo Web (web-only dependency surface)
- [ ] Make ELK layout + ReactFlow styling compatible with Expo Web bundling
- [ ] Tauri v2 shell points to Expo Web (`build.devUrl`, `build.frontendDist`, beforeDev/beforeBuild commands)

#### E2E testability
- [ ] Add missing `data-testid` coverage for: entity modal, relationship modal, registry editor, approvals panel, create/delete actions

**Phase 2: Knowledge PRs**
- Knowledge PRs inbox: unified review queue across `document`/`entity`/`relationship`/`memory` with filters + batch actions (label: “Changes to review”; opened from editor “Version history” menu item).
- Diff/preview: document diff + property/edge diff + JSON Patch view for opaque operations.
- History/rollback: revision timeline for accepted suggestions across graph + memory, with provenance links.

**Phase 3: Integrations + Citations (MCP)**
- Integrations settings: connect/disconnect, scopes, status, and audit for external sources.
- Evidence viewer: show source documents/excerpts and canon citation metadata; deep-link from lint/coach issues.
- Promote-to-model: promote evidence into the Living Model by creating a Knowledge PR with attached citations.

**Phase 4: Clarity/Policy Coach**
- Coach mode selector (Writing / Clarity / Policy) with taxonomy-aware labels.
- Issue UI: ambiguity/unverifiable/not-testable/policy-conflict categories while preserving the same “issue + suggested fix” structure.

### Phase 2: Knowledge PRs - Remaining Tasks (Production Hardening)

Goal: make Knowledge PRs a production-grade review surface: every PR is actionable, diffs are readable, approvals are safe, rollbacks are reliable, and provenance is navigable.

#### P0 - Production blockers (ship before beta)

1) Document PRs must be actionable (fix write_content approval UX) - Scope: M/L
   - Problem: applyDecisions cannot apply write_content ("Apply document changes from the editor UI."), but inbox UIs still show Approve.
   - Fix: in the inbox, replace Approve with Apply in editor for write_content suggestions; keep Reject supported from the inbox.
   - Add an editor -> backend resolution hook so applying in the editor marks the suggestion accepted and creates a revision with provenance (sourceSuggestionId).
   - Files:
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/KnowledgePRsView.tsx
     - muse/apps/expo/src/components/knowledge/KnowledgeSuggestionDetails.tsx
     - muse/convex/knowledgeSuggestions.ts (new: resolveWriteContentFromEditor)
     - muse/convex/revisions.ts (ensure revision provenance supports sourceSuggestionId)
     - Editor bridge: muse/packages/editor-webview/src/... (apply/resolve wiring)

2) Server-side preflight validation + conflict detection (block unsafe approvals) - Scope: L
   - Add a preflight step before apply that validates:
     - tool args shape (required fields present; updates/metadata types sane)
     - schema/registry constraints using resolved projectTypeRegistry
     - target resolution (entity/relationship uniqueness; source/target existence)
     - rollback safety (ensure "before" snapshot can be captured for updates)
     - conflict detection (fingerprint/hash of target fields being edited)
   - Persist preflight result on the suggestion so UI can disable Approve and surface errors/warnings.
   - Files:
     - muse/convex/knowledgeSuggestions.ts (preflight + apply gating)
     - muse/convex/schema.ts (optional: preflight, conflict, resolvedTargetId fields)
     - muse/convex/lib/typeRegistry.ts (reuse validateEntityProperties / validateRelationshipMetadata)
     - muse/convex/ai/agentRuntime.ts (optional: resolve targetId earlier for better UX)
   - Depends on: none (but improves rollback + diff UX).

3) Rollback hardening + explicit rolled-back state + audit events - Scope: M
   - Add idempotency guard (rollback called twice should be a no-op).
   - Store explicit rollback metadata (rolledBackAt, rolledBackByUserId, resolutionReason="rollback") for UI and filtering.
   - Emit activity events on rollback success/failure.
   - Optionally store minimal after snapshot at apply-time for better audit/diff.
   - Files:
     - muse/convex/knowledgeSuggestions.ts (rollbackSuggestion, markRolledBackInternal, applySuggestionApprove)
     - muse/convex/activity.ts (use existing emit)
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/KnowledgePRsView.tsx
     - muse/apps/expo/src/components/knowledge/KnowledgeSuggestionDetails.tsx

4) Inbox scalability: server-side filters + pagination - Scope: M
   - Add query-level filters for targetType, riskLevel, and optional rolled-back inclusion.
   - Add indexes for by_project_targetType_createdAt and by_project_status_targetType_createdAt.
   - Convert UIs from limit=200 to cursor-based paging.
   - Files:
     - muse/convex/knowledgeSuggestions.ts (listByProject)
     - muse/convex/schema.ts (indexes)
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/KnowledgePRsView.tsx
     - muse/apps/expo/src/components/knowledge/KnowledgePRsPanel.tsx

#### P1 - Important (post-beta)

5) Web parity for graph diffs (entity + relationship + metadata) - Scope: M
   - Port Expo field-by-field entity/relationship diff into Web details panel.
   - Add a readable metadata diff presentation (collapsed JSON with expand).
   - Files:
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/KnowledgePRsView.tsx
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/DiffViews.tsx (reuse/extend)

6) JSON Patch visualization for normalizedPatch - Scope: S/M
   - Add a compact JSON Patch viewer (op/path/value) for opaque operations.
   - Files:
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/KnowledgePRsView.tsx (new component usage)
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/JsonPatchView.tsx

7) Provenance + citations deep-links - Scope: M
   - Surface: model, threadId, streamId, toolCallId, promptMessageId prominently.
   - Add Open memory / Copy memory id for citations; add Copy provenance on Web.
   - Files:
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/KnowledgePRsView.tsx
     - muse/apps/expo/src/components/knowledge/KnowledgeSuggestionDetails.tsx

8) Inbox UX upgrades (filters, shortcuts, batch actions) - Scope: M
   - Add target-type filters (document/entity/relationship/memory).
   - Add keyboard shortcuts (approve/reject).
   - Add multi-select + batch approve/reject to Web (Expo already supports batch).
   - Files:
     - muse/apps/web/src/components/console/KnowledgePRsView.tsx
     - muse/apps/expo/src/components/knowledge/KnowledgePRsPanel.tsx

#### P2 - Nice-to-have / strategic cleanup

9) Clarify documentSuggestions vs knowledgeSuggestions (unify inbox or formalize split) - Scope: L
   - Decision target: keep document application on editor surface (intentional for MLP1), but keep review state in a unified inbox.
   - Either migrate documentSuggestions into knowledgeSuggestions, or provide a unified query/feed that merges both.
   - Files:
     - muse/convex/schema.ts
     - muse/convex/*Suggestions*.ts (depending on current documentSuggestions implementation)

10) Best-effort late-apply anchoring for write_content - Scope: M/L
   - If apply later must work, add stronger selection anchoring (prefix/suffix windows, offsets, or fuzzy matching).
   - Files:
     - muse/convex/ai/agentRuntime.ts (editorContext capture)
     - muse/apps/*/knowledge/* (apply UX)

## Writer Feedback Insights

> Source: German writing Discord (2026-01-09)

### What Writers Want

| Need | Mythos Feature | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| "Sortiermaschine" (auto-organize) | Project Graph + entity detection | ✅ Have |
| Grammar without changing meaning | DeepL API + approval-based | 🔲 P2 |
| Name lists | Name generator tool | 🔲 P2 |
| Logic checks (biology, math) | Validation tool (optional) | 🔲 P2 |
| Master document / artbook | Project = book, entities = artbook | ✅ Have |
| Idea collection WITHOUT judgment | Focus Mode (AI silent) | 🔲 P1 |
| Physical notebook feel | Simple UI, offline-first | ✅ Have |

### What Writers DON'T Want

| Anti-pattern | Our Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| AI plotting without permission | Approval-based suggestions only |
| AI evaluating/judging ideas | Focus Mode = no AI unless asked |
| Changing meaning of text | DeepL preserves intent; approval required |
| Constant interruptions | Proactive features are opt-in, background |

### Onboarding Questions to Add

1. **AI involvement level:**
   - "Help me actively" (suggestions on)
   - "Only when I ask" (manual trigger)
   - "Stay quiet" (Focus Mode default)

2. **Logic checking:**
   - "Check in background" (subtle highlights)
   - "Only when I ask"
   - "Skip logic checking"

3. **Grammar/spelling:**
   - "Check as I write" (DeepL/LLM)
   - "Only on demand"
   - "I use other tools"

### Export/Import System (Centralize to `@mythos/io`)

> **Status:** Built in `apps/web/src/services/`, needs centralization for Tauri/Expo reuse

|--------|--------|--------|
| Markdown | ✅ | ✅ |
| DOCX | ✅ | ✅ |
| PDF | ✅ | ❌ |
| EPUB | ✅ | ✅ |
| Plain text | ❌ | ✅ |

#### Migration Plan: `@mythos/io` Package

| Step | Task | Priority |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | Create `packages/io/` with package.json | P2 |
| 2 | Move export/ and import/ from apps/web | P2 |
| 3 | Platform-aware `download.ts` (web vs Tauri dialog) | P2 |
| 4 | Platform-aware `fileReader.ts` (web vs Tauri fs) | P2 |
| 5 | Update apps/web imports to `@mythos/io` | P2 |
| 6 | Wire up in Tauri + Expo | P2 |

#### Platform Adaptation

```typescript
// packages/io/src/utils/download.ts
import { platform } from '@mythos/platform';

export async function downloadBlob(blob: Blob, fileName: string) {
  if (platform.is('tauri')) {
    const { save } = await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog');
    const { writeFile } = await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-fs');
    const path = await save({ defaultPath: fileName });
    if (path) await writeFile(path, new Uint8Array(await blob.arrayBuffer()));
  } else {
    // Web browser download
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = url;
    a.download = fileName;
    a.click();
    URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
  }
}
```

### Gaps & Considerations

| Gap | Risk | Mitigation |
|-----|------|------------|
| **Export formats** | ✅ Have DOCX, PDF, ePub, Markdown | Centralize to @mythos/io |
| **Print formatting** | Manuscript formatting matters | P3: Page layout options |
| **Backup/sync visibility** | "Is my work saved?" anxiety | Show sync status clearly |
| **Mobile writing** | iPad is popular with writers | Expo iOS after web stable |
| **Dictation/voice** | Some writers dictate | P3: Whisper integration |
| **Reading mode** | Review without editing | Simple toggle, hide toolbars |
| **Dark mode** | Essential for long sessions | ✅ Have (theme system) |
| **Font choices** | Writers have preferences | P2: Custom fonts in editor |
| **Word count goals** | Daily/weekly/project targets | Part of Focus Mode |
| **Distraction sounds** | Typewriter clicks, ambient | P3: Optional audio feedback |

### Not Considered Yet

| Feature | Why It Might Matter |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Beta readers integration** | Share drafts, collect feedback |
| **Submission tracking** | Query letters, agent responses |
| **Writing group features** | Beyond collaboration — critique circles |
| **Dictation transcription** | Voice → text workflow |
| **Research clipping** | Web clipper for sources |
| **Outline/beat sheet views** | Visual story structure |
| **Character relationship map** | Visual Project Graph |
| **Timeline visualization** | Visual chapter/event ordering |

```

### Phase 3: Platform Integration (60%)

**Shared Packages** (✅ Centralized):
- `@mythos/state` - Zustand stores (AI, workspace, layout, command palette)
- `@mythos/commands` - Command registry and definitions
- `@mythos/analytics` - Typed event definitions
- `@mythos/theme` - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
- `@mythos/manifest` - Project tree logic (chapters, entities, memories)

**Apps:**
- `apps/expo/` - Universal app (web, iOS, macOS) - imports from shared packages
- `apps/tauri/` - macOS desktop - scaffold complete, ready for shared packages

### Phase 4: RAG Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE

```
convex/
├── ai/rag.ts                        # retrieveRAGContext + chunkContext
├── ai/lexical.ts                    # Full-text BM25
├── ai/embeddings.ts                 # Outbox pattern

└── crons.ts                         # 30s sync interval
```

**Features:**
- Hybrid search (dense + sparse) + RRF fusion
- Chunk context expansion via Qdrant scroll (N-2, N-1, hit, N+1)
- Diff-based embedding updates (content hash)
- Graceful degradation on Qdrant failure

#### Focus Mode (Distraction-Free Writing) 🔲 P1

> *"Ideen sammeln ohne das ein Computer diese bewertet"* — Writer feedback

| Component | Description | Platform |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Zen UI** | Hide sidebar, AI panel, just editor + word count | Expo web → Tauri |
| **Timer modes** | Pomodoro (25/5), Sprint (15min), Custom goals | Expo web → Tauri |
| **Word goals** | "Write 500 words" with progress bar, streak tracking | Expo web → Tauri |
| **"What If" cards** | Random prompts: "What if the villain is right?", "What if they fail?" | Expo web → Tauri |
| **Technique prompts** | "Describe using only sounds", "Write the opposite emotion" | Expo web → Tauri |
| **Session stats** | Words written, time focused, streak, export to PostHog | Expo web → Tauri |

**Key principle:** AI stays completely silent unless explicitly invoked. No suggestions, no analysis, no interruptions.

#### Grammar & Style Polish 🔲 P2

| Option | Pros | Decision |
|--------|------|----------|
| **DeepL Write API** | Excellent German, 500k chars/month free | ✅ Primary for German users |
| **LLM (existing)** | Multi-language, context-aware, style suggestions | ✅ Fallback + advanced style |
| **Harper** | Fast local, Apache-2.0 | ⚠️ Reference for highlight UX only (English-only, German too hard) |

**Highlight UX (Harper-style):**
- Underline squiggles for issues (red = error, yellow = suggestion)
- Hover tooltip with explanation + fix options
- Right-click context menu: "Fix", "Ignore", "Add to dictionary"
- Batch "Fix all" for repeated issues

**Integration:**
```
User writes → Idle 2s → DeepL/LLM check (background)
                              ↓
                    Highlight issues in editor
                              ↓
                    User clicks → Apply fix or dismiss
```

#### Name Generator Tool 🔲 P2

```typescript
// convex/ai/tools/creativeTools.ts
generateNames({
  type: "character" | "location" | "item" | "faction",
  culture: "Germanic" | "Japanese" | "Fantasy" | "Sci-Fi" | ...,
  count: 10,
  constraints: "starts with K" | "two syllables" | ...
}) → string[]
```

Uses project's existing entities + world style for consistency.

#### Logic Validation Tool 🔲 P2

| Feature | Description | Configurable |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Timeline checker** | "Day 3 can't be before Day 1" | ✅ On/off in settings |
| **Math execution** | LLM writes Python → sandboxed eval → result | ✅ On/off |
| **Biology/physics** | "Humans can't survive 30 days without water" | ✅ On/off |
| **World rules** | Validate against user-defined magic system rules | ✅ On/off |

**Proactive validation behavior:**
- **NOT blocking** — runs in background after idle
- **NOT immediate** — batched every few minutes or on document save
- **User controls** — configurable in onboarding + settings:
  - "Check my logic as I write" (background, non-blocking)
  - "Only check when I ask" (manual trigger)
  - "Never check logic" (full creative freedom)

**Onboarding question:**
> "Some writers want logic checking (timeline, physics, world rules). Others prefer full creative freedom. What works for you?"
> - [ ] Check in background (subtle highlights)
> - [ ] Only when I ask
> - [ ] Skip logic checking

#### Exa Web Search 🔲 P2

```typescript
// convex/ai/tools/researchTools.ts
webSearch({
  query: "Victorian era clothing for nobility",
  type: "historical" | "scientific" | "general"
}) → { title, url, excerpt }[]
```

- Cost: ~$0.001/search
- Use cases: historical accuracy, research, fact-checking
- Integrated as agent tool: "Is this historically accurate?" → triggers search

| **Host** | `qdrant.cascada.vision:6333` |
| **Collections** | `saga_vectors`, `saga_images` |
| **Embedding Model** | `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` (4096 dims) |
| **Distance** | Cosine |

### Failure Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Qdrant unreachable | Tool returns error, agent uses thread context only |
| Embedding API fails | Retry 3x with backoff, graceful degradation |
| Rerank slow (>500ms) | Skip reranking, use Qdrant scores directly |

## Context Budgeter (100k total)

| Priority | Source | Max Tokens | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| 1 | System prompt + tools | 3k | Fixed overhead |
| 2 | Active doc delta | 15k | Changes since lastSeenVersion |
| 3 | Pinned docs (auto + manual) | 20k | Smart pinning included |
| 4 | RAG top-K results | 25k | After rerank, ~5 chunks |
| 5 | Thread history + summary | 30k | Rolling summary for old messages |
| 6 | Response reserve | 7k | For model output |

### Smart Pinning (Automatic, max 3)

- Editing scene with POV character → auto-pin character sheet
- Mentions location → auto-pin location doc
- References past event → auto-pin timeline
- Show in context scope UI so user can unpin

## Skills System (Agent-Invocable Tools)

### Philosophy

**No slash commands.** The agent understands natural language intent and invokes skills as tools.

- User says: "Help me plan act 2" → Agent invokes `plan_story` tool
- User says: "I want to develop Elena more" → Agent invokes `develop_character` tool
- User says: "Is this historically accurate?" → Agent invokes `research_facts` tool

### Core Skills (as Tools)

| Tool Name | Description (for LLM) | What It Does |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| `plan_story` | Help user plan story structure, plot arcs, beat sheets | Generates outlines, timelines |
| `build_world` | Help develop worldbuilding: factions, magic, geography | Creates/refines world elements |
| `develop_character` | Deep dive into character arc, motivation, backstory | Character analysis |
| `research_facts` | Fact-check historical accuracy, find sources | RAG + Exa web search |
| `web_search` | Search the web for current info, documentation | Exa API |
| `analyze_writing` | Analyze quality: show-don't-tell, pacing, tension | Metrics + suggestions |
| `detect_entities` | Extract characters, locations, items from text | Entity detection |
| `check_consistency` | Find plot holes, timeline issues | Consistency linting |

### Exa Web Search Integration

```typescript
// convex/ai/skills/research.ts
import Exa from 'exa-js';

const exa = new Exa(process.env.EXA_API_KEY);

export const webSearchTool = tool({
  description: 'Search web for facts, historical accuracy, research',
  parameters: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
    type: z.enum(['general', 'historical', 'scientific']).optional(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ query, type }) => {
    const { results } = await exa.searchAndContents(query, {
      livecrawl: 'always',
      numResults: 5,
      type: type === 'historical' ? 'keyword' : 'neural',
    });
    return results.map(r => ({
      title: r.title,
      url: r.url,
      excerpt: r.text.slice(0, 1500),
    }));
  },
});
```

**Cost:** ~$0.001/search

## Conflict Resolution + Batch Approval

### Conflict Staging Flow

```
AI insertion requested (5s soft lock)
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│ Set soft lock    │ pendingAIWrite: { range, expiresAt: +5s }
└────────┬─────────┘
         │

         │
    ┌────┴────┐
   No        Yes
    │         │
    ▼         ▼

           (not in doc yet)
              │
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Conflict Staging Panel              │
│ "AI wants to insert here, but you   │
│  edited nearby. Review the change:" │
│                                     │
│ [Your edit]    │  [AI suggestion]   │

│ [Keep Mine] [Use AI] [Merge] [Skip] │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Batch Approval (Reduce Approval Fatigue)

When multiple AI suggestions are pending:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3 AI suggestions pending                                    │
│                                                             │
│ [Preview All] [Accept All (3)] [Reject All] [Review 1-by-1] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Auto-Batch Thresholds:**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 1 suggestion | Inline buttons only |
| 2-5 suggestions | BatchApprovalBar + inline |
| 6+ suggestions | BatchApprovalBar only (hide inline) |
| Same paragraph | Group as single suggestion |

---

## QA Harness for RAG Quality

### Automated Test Suite

- Agent streaming E2E tests (convex-test + AI SDK mock model)
- Tool-call loop coverage (auto tools, approval tools, resume)
- ChunkContext expansion regression coverage

```typescript
// packages/qa/src/rag-harness.ts
interface RAGTestCase {
  id: string;
  projectType: 'fantasy' | 'scifi' | 'romance' | 'thriller';
  query: string;
  expectedChunks: string[];  // chunkIds that should appear
  minRelevanceScore?: number;
}

const testCases: RAGTestCase[] = [
  {
    id: 'fantasy-character-lookup',
    projectType: 'fantasy',
    query: 'What is Elena\'s motivation?',
    expectedChunks: ['elena-backstory', 'elena-arc-ch3'],
    minRelevanceScore: 0.8,
  },
  // 20-50 test cases per project type
];
```

### Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Formula | Target | Alert |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Recall@K** | (relevant in top-K) / (total relevant) | >80% | <70% |
| **MRR** | 1 / rank of first relevant | >0.6 | <0.4 |
| **Reranker Lift** | MRR(with) - MRR(without) | >0.15 | <0.05 |

## Security & Audit

### Permission Model

| Tool | Permission |
|------|------------|
| `ask_question`, `open_panel`, `focus_entity` | None (auto-approve) |
| `search_context`, `analyze_style` | None (read-only) |
| `write_content`, `create_entity`, `create_relationship` | Approval required |

### RLS Considerations

- All queries check `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`
- Qdrant queries always filter by `projectId`
- Tool calls validated against project ownership
- AI cannot access documents outside project scope
- Rate limits per user, not global

### Audit Trail

| Data | Retention | Storage |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Tool call traces | 90 days | Thread message metadata |
| Rejected AI suggestions | 90 days | Thread message metadata |
| Approval decisions | 1 year | Separate audit log (optional) |
| Aggregated metrics | Forever | PostHog |

### Rate Limits

| Limit | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Embeddings/day | 1000 | Alert at 80%, block at 100% |
| AI calls/day | 100 (free), 1000 (pro) | Graceful degradation |
| Background tasks | 10 jobs/min | Throttle queue |

---

## Idle Save + Qdrant Sync

### Editor Autosave

```
Keystroke → Local draft (250-500ms debounce)
                │
                ▼
         Idle detected (1-2s pause)
                │
                ▼
         Push to Convex (version++)
                │
                ▼
         Enqueue embedding job
```

### Embedding Outbox Pattern

```typescript
// Already in convex/schema.ts
embeddingJobs: defineTable({
  projectId: v.id("projects"),
  targetType: v.string(),        // "document" | "entity"
  targetId: v.string(),
  status: v.string(),            // "pending" | "processing" | "synced" | "failed"
  attempts: v.number(),
  lastError: v.optional(v.string()),
  desiredContentHash: v.optional(v.string()),
  processedContentHash: v.optional(v.string()),
  dirty: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  processingRunId: v.optional(v.string()),
  processingStartedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  nextRunAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  failedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  queuedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  updatedAt: v.number(),
  createdAt: v.number(),
})
```

### Retry Logic

- Max 5 retries: 30s, 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m (exponential backoff)
- `nextRunAt` gates debounce + retry backoff
- Processing lease requeues stuck jobs (stale processing recovery)
- After 5 failures: status = `failed`, requires manual retry

### Vector Delete Outbox

- Server-side deletes enqueue `vectorDeleteJobs` for documents/entities
- Jobs are reclaimed if they remain `processing` past the lease window

### SyncStatus UI

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Documents                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ● Chapter 1: Origins        ✓ Synced    │
│ ● Chapter 2: The Call       ↻ Syncing   │
│ ● Chapter 3: The Escape     ⏳ Pending  │
│ ● Chapter 4: Betrayal       ⚠ Failed    │
│   └─ [Retry] Qdrant timeout             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Status | Icon | Color |
|--------|------|-------|
| `synced` | ✓ | Green |
| `pending` | ⏳ | Yellow |
| `processing` | ↻ | Blue |
| `failed` | ⚠ | Red |

---

## UI Enhancements

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Context Inspector** | Token counts before sending ("Context: 72k/100k") |
| **Diff View** | Inline additions (green) / deletions (red), toggle |
| **Batch Approval** | "Approve all (3)" floating bar when multiple pending |
| **Suggestion Mode** | Stream to preview panel instead of direct insert (opt-in) |
| **Rejection Feedback** | Optional reason capture (wrong tone, etc.) for learning |
| **Tool Transparency** | "Sources" expandable with top-K chunks + scores |
| **Memory Dashboard** | "What AI learned" - style vectors, decisions, entity count |
| **Project Type Registry** | Project settings UI for `projectTypeRegistry` (types, risk levels, optional JSON schema) |
| **Knowledge PRs Inbox** | Unified review queue for `knowledgeSuggestions` across graph/memory/docs with batch actions |
| **Diff/Preview** | Document diff + graph/memory patch preview (incl. JSON Patch / property diffs) |
| **Integrations (MCP)** | Connection management (scopes, status, audit) and MCP tool transparency |
| **Graph/Memory History** | Revision timeline + rollback UX for entities/relationships/memories |
| **Coach Modes** | Writing / Clarity / Policy mode selector and taxonomy-aware issue UI |

## Remaining Work

### MLP1 Ship Checklist (Writer-First)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Focus Mode MVP (AI silent unless invoked) | 🔲 | Zen UI, no proactive interruptions, manual invoke only |
| Focus sessions (timer + word goals) | 🔲 | Pomodoro/sprint/custom, session stats |
| Living Model UI entry points | ✅ | Cmd+K “Changes to review” + editor More menu (“Version history”) opens review panel; home entry point TBD |
| Knowledge PRs review UX (polish) | ✅ (MVP, not production-ready) | Approve/reject + batch actions + provenance + undo (graph/memory); document apply remains editor UI |
| Project Graph editor UX | 🔲 | Create/edit nodes/edges; registry-aware type picker + properties editor |
| Lint → “jump to canon” UX | 🔲 | Canon citations link to Decision Ledger items |
| Clarity/Policy Coach UX | ✅ | Mode selector + taxonomy-aware issues + two-step pin approval modal |
| E2E coverage for new surfaces | 🔲 | Stable `data-testid` hooks per `muse/docs/E2E_TESTABILITY_CONTRACT.md` |

### P1: Living Model UI (Design)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Project Type Registry screen | 🔲 | Manage types, risk levels, optional JSON schema; drives create/edit and approvals |
| Project Graph editor UX | 🔲 | Node/edge create/edit for `type` + `properties` (schema-driven when available) |
| Knowledge PRs inbox UX | ✅ (MVP, not production-ready) | Expo Web right-panel (“Changes to review”) + web console view; filters, selection, batch approve/reject |
| Knowledge PR diff/preview components | ✅ (MVP, not production-ready) | Entity/relationship diffs + memory preview + raw + normalized JSON Patch; write_content diff (selection/context excerpt) |
| Knowledge history + rollback UX | ✅ (MVP, not production-ready) | Undo supported for accepted suggestions with rollback metadata (graph/memory) |
| Integrations settings UX | 🔲 | Connections, scopes, status, and audit trail for external sources |
| Evidence + citations UX | 🔲 | Knowledge PR detail shows citations (Expo + web console); jump-to-canon from lint/coach still missing |
| Promote-to-model flow UX | 🔲 | From evidence/context inspector → create Knowledge PR with citations |
| Coach mode selector UX | ✅ | Writing / Clarity / Policy modes with mode-specific content + issue taxonomy |

### P2: Collaboration UI (Expo Web)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Expo-web UI for revision history or activity feed | 🔲 | Add to EditorShell layout for web-only experience |
| Revision history/restore UI | 🔲 | Subtle, integrated panel (no modal spam) |
| Activity feed UI | 🔲 | Designed as a low-noise, contextual feed |

### MLP3: Writer Studio (Exploration)

These build on the Living Model + Decision Ledger + Knowledge PRs to help writers iterate into new media formats.

| Idea | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Manga/storyboard generation | Turn scenes into panels, beats, captions, and shot composition references |
| Series bible / lorebook compiler | Auto-compile canon, characters, factions, timeline into a shareable bible |
| Presentation/pitch deck generator | Convert project truth into a clean pitch deck with citations to canon |
| Trailer / series video planning | Scene → shot list → storyboard frames; future: video generation toolchain |
| World simulation agent | Maintain consistent world state over time and propose canon updates as PRs |

### Research Spikes (Product Teams)

| Spike | Goal | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| GitHub integration (evidence + change events) | Improve “what changed” understanding and drift detection for product teams | Treat as evidence/ingest + citations + Impact PRs; avoid “index everything” positioning |

### Phase 3: Platform Integration

#### Tauri macOS (Scaffold Complete)

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Tauri v2 app shell | ✅ |
| Editor iframe + bridge | ✅ |
| useEditorBridge hook | ✅ |
| macOS titlebar (overlay) | ✅ |
| Asset protocol + CSP | ✅ |
| Turborepo integration | ✅ |

#### Tauri ← Expo Web Convergence (Next)

**Philosophy:** Treat desktop as **capability-based**, not platform forks. No `.tauri.ts` proliferation.

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Point Tauri devUrl to Expo Web (`:19006`) | 🔲 |
| 2 | Test all features in WebView context | 🔲 |
| 3 | Create `@mythos/platform` capability layer | 🔲 |
| 4 | Production: Expo export → Tauri resources | 🔲 |
| 5 | Native macOS menus via Tauri Menu API | 🔲 |
| 6 | Code signing + notarization | 🔲 |
| 7 | Auto-updater integration | 🔲 |

#### `@mythos/platform` Capability Layer

Single abstraction for platform capabilities (no scattered `.tauri.ts` files):

```
packages/platform/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # Platform detection + capability exports
│   ├── capabilities/
│   │   ├── storage.ts        # Persistent key-value storage
│   │   ├── fs.ts             # File system access
│   │   ├── menus.ts          # Native menus (Tauri only)
│   │   ├── updater.ts        # Auto-update (Tauri only)
│   │   └── window.ts         # Window controls
│   └── adapters/
│       ├── tauri/            # Tauri plugin implementations
│       ├── web/              # Web API implementations
│       └── native/           # React Native implementations
```

**Capability Matrix:**

| Capability | Web | Tauri | React Native |
|------------|-----|-------|--------------|
| `storage` | localStorage | `tauri-plugin-store` | SecureStore/AsyncStorage |
| `fs` | File System Access API | `tauri-plugin-fs` | react-native-fs |
| `menus` | ❌ | Native AppKit menus | ❌ |
| `updater` | ❌ | `tauri-plugin-updater` | App Store |
| `window` | ❌ | `@tauri-apps/api/window` | ❌ |

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { storage, fs, platform } from '@mythos/platform';

// Auto-selects correct implementation
await storage.set('recentProjects', projectIds);
const data = await fs.readFile(path);

if (platform.capabilities.menus) {
  menus.setApplicationMenu(writerMenus);
}
```

#### Native macOS Menus (Tauri v2 Menu API)

Ship expected Mac affordances via `@tauri-apps/api/menu`:

```typescript
// packages/platform/src/adapters/tauri/menus.ts
import { Menu, MenuItem, Submenu } from '@tauri-apps/api/menu';

const fileMenu = await Submenu.new({
  text: 'File',
  items: [
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'New Project', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+N', action: 'new_project' }),
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'Open...', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+O', action: 'open_project' }),
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'Export...', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+Shift+E', action: 'export' }),
  ],
});

const editMenu = await Submenu.new({
  text: 'Edit',
  items: [
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'Undo', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+Z', action: 'undo' }),
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'Redo', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+Shift+Z', action: 'redo' }),
    { item: 'Separator' },
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'Find...', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+F', action: 'find' }),
  ],
});

const viewMenu = await Submenu.new({
  text: 'View',
  items: [
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'Toggle Sidebar', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+\\', action: 'toggle_sidebar' }),
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'Zen Mode', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+Shift+F', action: 'zen_mode' }),
    await MenuItem.new({ text: 'AI Panel', accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+J', action: 'toggle_ai' }),
  ],
});
```

#### Code Signing + Notarization (macOS)

**Required for distribution** (avoid "app is damaged" warnings):

```json
// apps/tauri/src-tauri/tauri.macos.conf.json
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "signingIdentity": "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)",
      "providerShortName": "TEAMID",
      "entitlements": "./entitlements.plist",
      "minimumSystemVersion": "10.15"
    }
  }
}
```

| Task | Tool | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Code signing | `codesign` | Apple Developer Certificate |
| Notarization | `notarytool` | Required for Gatekeeper |
| Stapling | `stapler` | Offline verification |
| CI automation | GitHub Actions | `tauri-action` handles this |

#### Auto-Updater (Tauri v2)

```typescript
// packages/platform/src/adapters/tauri/updater.ts
import { check } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-updater';
import { relaunch } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-process';

export async function checkForUpdates() {
  const update = await check();
  if (update) {
    await update.downloadAndInstall();
    await relaunch();
  }
}
```

**Update server options:**
- GitHub Releases (free, recommended)
- S3/CloudFlare R2 (self-hosted)
- Custom endpoint

#### Platform-Specific Config Overlays

Tauri v2 supports config merging for platform-specific settings:

```
apps/tauri/src-tauri/
├── tauri.conf.json           # Base config (all platforms)
├── tauri.macos.conf.json     # macOS: signing, entitlements, sandbox
├── tauri.windows.conf.json   # Windows: installer, code signing
└── tauri.linux.conf.json     # Linux: AppImage, deb settings
```

#### Expo iOS/iPad (Future)

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| MythosEditor WebView wrapper | 🔲 |
| Touch keyboard handling | 🔲 |
| Offline queue sync | 🔲 |
| iPad trackpad/mouse support | 🔲 |

#### Web → Shared Packages Refactor (Post-MLP1)

After Expo-web is finalized, migrate remaining `apps/web/` code to shared packages.

**Move to `@mythos/state`:**

| File | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `stores/navigation.ts` | Navigation state |
| `stores/projectSelection.ts` | Selected project |
| `stores/chatSessionStorage.ts` | Chat persistence |

**Move to `@mythos/platform`:**

| File | Capability |
|------|------------|
| `stores/memory.ts` | `storage` adapter |
| File open/save logic | `fs` adapter |

**Keep platform-specific:**

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `stores/undo.ts` | Editor UX - needs client-side speed |
| `stores/history.ts` | Session stats - sync aggregates to Convex |

### Phase 5: Skills + Polish

| Skill | Purpose | Effort |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `plan_story` | Plot arcs, beat sheets | 4h |
| `build_world` | Factions, magic, geography | 4h |
| `develop_character` | Arc, motivation, backstory | 3h |
| `research_facts` | RAG + Exa web search | 3h |
| `analyze_writing` | SDT, pacing, tension | 2h |

  streamStarted,      // AI stream begins
  ragContextRetrieved, // RAG results count
  streamCompleted,    // Duration + tokens
  streamFailed,       // Error tracking
};
```

### Microsoft Clarity ✅

Session replays for desktop (Tauri). Linked to PostHog user IDs.

```typescript

### Rate Limits Configured

| Limit | Algorithm | Rate | Period | Shards |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| `login` | token bucket | 5/min | 1 min | - |
| `failedLogin` | token bucket | 3/15min | 15 min | - |
| `signup` | fixed window | 3/hr | 1 hour | - |
| `aiRequest` | token bucket | 20/min | 1 min | - |
| `aiTokenUsage` | token bucket | 50k/min | 1 min | 10 |
| `globalAiTokenUsage` | token bucket | 500k/min | 1 min | 50 |
| `sendMessage` | token bucket | 30/min | 1 min | - |
| `webhook` | token bucket | 1000/min | 1 min | 10 |
| `embedding` | token bucket | 100/min | 1 min | - |

### Best Practices Applied

- **Reserve pattern**: `check()` before with estimate, `limit()` after with actual
- **Dual limits**: Per-user AND global for token usage
- **Sharding**: High-throughput limits use shards (QPS/2 formula)
- **UsageHandler**: Integrated with @convex-dev/agent for automatic tracking
- **Cost tracking**: Microdollars per request stored in DB

### Remaining Tasks (Supabase Migration)

All Supabase → Convex migration tasks complete.

### P1: Performance Stabilization

| Task | Files | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Cursor write rate reduction | `CollaborativeEditor.tsx` | 120ms → 350ms throttle, skip if unchanged, focus-gated |
| AI presence keepalive | `agentRuntime.ts` | Tick presence every ~5-10s during long streams |
| Embedding job deduplication | `embeddings.ts`, `schema.ts` | Skip if pending job exists for same target |

### P2: Notion+Cursor Product Gaps

| Task | Files | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Collaborative suggestions** | New `convex/suggestions.ts` | ✅ Done — persisted suggestions + editor hydration |
| **Version history + restore** | New `convex/revisions.ts` | ✅ Done — revision log + server-side restore |
| **Block identity layer** | New `extensions/block-id.ts` | ✅ Done — stable UUIDs on block nodes |
| **Activity log** | New `convex/activity.ts` | ✅ Done — audit trail for AI + human ops |

> **Note:** Version history must track full actor context (which user, which collaborator, which AI agent/tool) to enable proper rollback UX and audit. UI for history/restore is a major focus area.

### Backend Schema TODOs (Stubbed Hooks)

| Schema | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `mentions` table | P3 | Entity mentions in documents. Hooks stubbed in `useMentionPersistence.ts` |
| `progressiveState` table | P3 | Progressive disclosure state per project. Hooks stubbed in `useProgressiveSync.ts` |

**Migration script:** `bun scripts/analyze-db-migration.ts` generates `DB_MIGRATION_REPORT.md`

### Tables to DEPRECATE

| Table | Reason | Migration Plan |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| `activity_log` | High-volume append-only | PostHog events |
| `ai_request_logs` | Analytics | `aiUsage` table |
| `chat_sessions` | Start fresh | Agent threads |
| `profiles` | Better Auth | Already handled |

## Tools Status

### Agent Tools ✅ (All Migrated)

| Tool | Approval | Location |
|------|----------|----------|
| `ask_question` | Always | `convex/ai/tools/editorTools.ts` |
| `write_content` | Always | `convex/ai/tools/editorTools.ts` |
| `search_context` | Auto | `convex/ai/tools/ragTools.ts` |

| `create_relationship` | **Dynamic** | `convex/ai/tools/projectGraphTools.ts` |
| `update_relationship` | **Dynamic** | `convex/ai/tools/projectGraphTools.ts` |

### Dynamic Approval Logic (`convex/lib/approvalConfig.ts`)

| Entity Type | Auto-Execute | Requires Approval |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `item`, `location`, `event`, `concept` | ✅ Low impact | |
| `character`, `faction`, `magic_system` | | ✅ High impact |

| Relationship Type | Auto-Execute | Requires Approval |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `knows`, `located_in`, `contains` | ✅ Low impact | |
| `parent_of`, `child_of`, `allied_with`, `enemy_of`, `owns`, `serves` | | ✅ High impact |

### Remaining Tools 🔲

| Tool | Location | Priority |
|------|----------|----------|
| `genesis_world` | `convex/ai/genesis.ts` | P2 |
| `detect_entities` (streaming) | `convex/ai/detect.ts` | ✅ Done |

---

## Bridge Protocol (Cross-Platform)

| Platform | Detection | To Native | From Native |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Web | Neither | N/A | N/A |
| Tauri | `__TAURI__` | `invoke()` | `evaluate_script()` |
| Expo | `ReactNativeWebView` | `postMessage()` | `injectJavaScript()` |

---

## Key Decisions (Locked)

| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Backend | 100% Convex | Offline-first, real-time, self-hosted |
| Auth | Better Auth | Full control, Convex native |
| Billing | RevenueCat | Required for App Store IAP |
| Threads | @convex-dev/agent | Built-in persistence + streaming |
| Reranker | DeepInfra Qwen3-4B | Cost-effective, accurate |
| Editor | WebView + TipTap | ProseMirror requires DOM |
| Diff UI | Custom SuggestionPlugin | Open source, full control |
| Platform priority | Web → macOS → iOS | Writer desktop usage |
| Privacy | Never send content to PostHog | Metadata only |

## Phase 12: CI/CD (GitHub Actions) ✅ COMPLETE

### Files Created

```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml                          # Typecheck, lint, test on PR/push
└── deploy-convex.yml               # Auto-deploy Convex on changes
```

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

| Job | Command | Trigger |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `typecheck` | `bun run typecheck` | PR + push to main |
| `lint` | `bun run lint` | PR + push to main |
| `test` | `bunx vitest convex/ai/__tests__ --run` | PR + push to main |

### E2E (Playwright)

- Status: Infra + initial suites in place (Expo web primary; Tauri web content validation).
- Coverage: Auth, project/document create + editor persistence, detect+persist (mockable).
- Entry points: `bun run e2e:expo`, `bun run e2e:tauri`, `E2E_MOCK_AI=true`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_E2E=true`.
- Note: Project Graph UI tests are deferred until graph exists in Expo/Tauri.

### Convex Deploy Workflow (`deploy-convex.yml`)

Auto-deploys Convex when files in `convex/` change on main branch.

### GitHub Secrets Required

> **Note:** Configure these in GitHub repo settings → Secrets when ready to enable CI.

| Secret | Purpose | How to Get |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` | Auto-deploy Convex | `npx convex deploy-key` |
| `CONVEX_URL` | E2E tests | Your Convex deployment URL |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | E2E tests (AI calls) | OpenRouter dashboard |
