## Quick Prompts

**To a novelist:**
> "Rhei is like a research assistant who's read your entire manuscript. It remembers every detail, catches when you contradict yourself, and stays quiet while you write."

**To a PM:**
> "Rhei is version control for your specs. When requirements change, it shows you what else needs to update."

**To a skeptic:**
> "It's not autocomplete. It's not trying to write for you. It just remembers what you wrote and tells you when you contradict yourself."
