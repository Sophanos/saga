# Competitor Comparison

> Rhei vs writing tools and productivity apps (updated January 2026)

---

## Executive Summary

1. **The writing market is split between "beautiful but dumb" and "powerful but chaotic."** Rhei's best strategic position is to own the third lane: *distraction-free canvas + structured story intelligence + governed outputs*. Your internal phrase "Freedom with receipts" is the right north star.

2. **AI-first tools win on ideation speed but lose on trust and control.** Their weakness is not model quality; it's UX (AI-forward), provenance (few receipts), and long-form governance (hard to keep canon coherent). Sudowrite's bundled "credits" model is especially vulnerable to a product that makes costs predictable and outputs reviewable.

3. **Codex-style tools (NovelCrafter) prove the demand for structured context, but the workflow is still "manual."** Rhei can replace "manual codex upkeep" with **automatic entity detection + Project Graph + Coherence**, while keeping the writing surface calm. NovelCrafter's pricing and feature set make this clear (Codex emphasis across plans).

4. **Notion is becoming an "AI platform for work," not a writing environment.** Their Business plan explicitly leans into AI agents, enterprise search, and meeting notes—excellent for teams, not optimized for long-form fiction flow.

5. **Obsidian's gravity is "local-first, link-first, plugin-first."** Writers accept its lack of native AI because it is fast, offline, and extensible. That is a warning: Rhei must be meaningfully better at *focus + structured memory + exports* to pull Obsidian writers over.

6. **Pricing clarity is a moat if you can keep it honest.** Rhei Pro at $14.99 for 500K tokens yields about **$0.03 per 1K tokens** (predictable). Many competitors do not publish token equivalents, making "value" feel fuzzy—an opportunity for Rhei to win with transparency.

## Rhei's Philosophy: "Intelligence on Invitation"

**Rhei is NOT another notes app. It's a context ingestion + focused writing system.**

Rhei occupies the unique quadrant: DISTRACTION-FREE + AI-CAPABLE
```

### Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Canvas is sacred** | Clean editor by default. No AI pop-ups, suggestions, or interruptions. |
| **Cmd+K summons power** | All AI accessed via command palette or slash commands. You invoke it. |
| **Context is automatic** | Entity detection runs silently. AI knows your characters without asking. |
| **Memory is persistent** | AI remembers across sessions, chapters, and projects. |
| **Writer owns the flow** | AI assists your vision. It never leads or overwrites without permission. |

### What Rhei IS

- A **context-aware writing environment** for creative writers
- A **distraction-free canvas** with AI that appears only when summoned
- A **story intelligence system** that tracks entities and relationships
- A **collaboration platform** for writing teams
- A **modern, cloud-native** alternative to legacy tools

### What Rhei is NOT

- NOT a notes app (Notion, Obsidian)
- NOT an AI that writes for you (Jasper, Copy.ai)
- NOT a legacy desktop app (Scrivener)
- NOT just a pretty editor (iA Writer)
- NOT an AI-first tool where AI is always suggesting (Sudowrite)

---

## 1. Market Segmentation Analysis

Below is the market as it actually behaves (not how companies describe themselves), and where Rhei can exploit weaknesses.

### Segment A — Minimalist Editors (iA Writer, Bear, Typora, Ulysses)

**Primary persona**
- Essayists, bloggers, journalists, "daily writers," and fiction writers who value *flow* above organization.

**Typical pricing**
- One-time purchase or low subscription; light feature sets; minimal infrastructure.

**What they do well**
- Calm typography, focus mode, speed, minimal UI.

**Structural weaknesses**
- **No structured memory** (characters, places, canon) without manual work.
- **No governance**: no receipts/provenance, no decision ledger.
- **No automation** beyond basic exports.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Steal this segment with a "modern iA Writer that *remembers*":
  - Flow Mode + typewriter + dimming (you already have this direction).
  - **On-demand** AI only (Cmd+K / slash).
  - Automatic entity detection + "quiet" Coherence signals (no popups).
  - "Receipts by default" for any non-trivial output (manifest + sources).

**Blunt truth**
- If Flow Mode doesn't feel world-class, iA Writer users won't care about your graph.

---

### Segment B — Novelist Tools (Scrivener, Atticus, Dabble)

**Primary persona**
- Serious long-form novelists and self-publishers; organization-heavy; "binder/corkboard" mental model.

**Typical pricing**
- One-time license or higher-priced subscriptions.

**What they do well**
- Long-form organization, compilation/export (especially for publishing workflows).

**Structural weaknesses**
- **Dated UX** (in many cases) and weak collaboration.
- **No AI-native governance** (no reviewable PRs, no provenance).
- Manual tracking of canon (character sheets, notes) doesn't scale cleanly.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Win with "cloud-native Scrivener" *without Scrivener complexity*:
  - Outline/binder parity is needed over time, but not first.
  - Deliver "compile-grade exports" (ePub/manuscript workflows) earlier than you'd like—this is table stakes in this segment.

---

### Segment C — AI-First Writing Tools (Sudowrite, NovelCrafter, Jasper)

**Primary persona**
- Fiction writers who want ideation, rewriting, and momentum; also some marketing/copy personas.

**Typical pricing**
- Subscription; often **metered** via credits/usage.
- Example: Sudowrite markets multiple paid tiers with monthly "credits."
- NovelCrafter is subscription-based with plans emphasizing AI writing + Codex, plus an enterprise tier.

**What they do well**
- Fast generation, brainstorming, and "unstuck" workflows.

**Structural weaknesses**
- **Control + trust gap**: it's easy for the tool to start "writing for you."
- **Canon drift**: long projects degrade without strong coherence systems.
- **Receipts are weak**: hard to justify *why* something is true.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Compete by reframing AI as *governed automation*:
  - Widgets → preview → confirm → apply (your spec nails this).
  - "Knowledge PRs" for graph/memory changes: reviewable, attributable, reversible.
  - Coherence system as a silent compiler: voice drift, world fact conflicts, timeline errors.

**Blunt truth**
- You don't beat these tools by "more generations." You beat them by "more correctness + more control."

---

### Segment D — General Productivity Platforms (Notion, Google Docs, Craft)

**Primary persona**
- Teams and knowledge workers; writing is *a means*, not the product.

**Typical pricing**
- Per-seat SaaS. Notion's published pricing shows Plus at $10 and Business at $20 per member/month.

**What they do well**
- Collaboration, flexible databases, integrations.

**Structural weaknesses (for creative writing)**
- UI becomes a management surface, not a writing surface.
- Structure is generic; long-form creative workflows are bolted on.
- AI is integrated as a broad capability, not writer-centric flow.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Position as: **"Notion for long-form creative work is a compromise. Rhei is purpose-built."**
- Still: you must match "good enough" collaboration and sharing.

---

### Segment E — Screenwriting Tools (Final Draft, Arc Studio, Fade In)

**Primary persona**
- Screenwriters and production teams.

**Typical pricing**
- Often higher-priced, format-enforced tools.

**What they do well**
- Industry-standard formatting, collaboration/commenting in script workflows.

**Structural weaknesses**
- Less strong on "world model" and canon reasoning (unless manually maintained).
- AI is usually not deeply integrated with structured story intelligence.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Longer-term: treat screenplay as another "facet" of the same Living Model.
- Near-term: don't chase format compliance until the core writing + canon system is proven.

---

## 2. AI Writing Tools Deep Dive

### 2.1 Sudowrite ($10-22/mo)

**What it is**
- An AI-forward fiction writing tool with paid tiers and usage framed in "credits."

**How it handles context / memory**
- Strong at short-term context and feature-driven transformations (rewrite, expand, brainstorm).
- Long-form consistency typically relies on the user re-feeding context or using built-in story tools.

**Why users like it**
- Immediate ideation velocity.
- "Unstuck" workflows are the product.

**Where it's weak (Rhei attack surface)**
- **AI-forward presence**: it can feel like a machine in the room.
- **Governance gap**: it's not built as a reviewable "truth system" with provenance.
- **Economics opacity**: credits are not intuitive tokens; "how much can I do?" becomes cognitive overhead.

**Rhei counter-position**
- "Same creative acceleration, but with *control and receipts*."
- Your "preview → confirm → apply" pipeline is the wedge.
- Pair it with Coherence: "the tool catches drift before it becomes a rewrite nightmare."

---

### 2.2 NovelCrafter ($8-20/mo + Enterprise)

**What it is**
- A novelist-centric tool with strong Codex positioning and tiered plans.

**Notable feature signals (from pricing page)**
- **"Write with AI"** appears even in Standard.
- Codex is central: "Unlimited Codex Entries," plus Codex enhancements in higher tiers (highlights, detail lines, custom attributes).
- Higher tiers lean into customization and API access.

**Why it matters strategically**
- It validates that serious writers want a structured "world model," not just a prompt box.

**Where it's weak (Rhei attack surface)**
- Codex upkeep is still a *front-loaded cognitive tax*.
- A Codex is not the same as a **living model with governance**:
  - Not just "store facts," but "review changes," "link evidence," and "propagate impact."

**Rhei counter-position**
- Replace manual codex maintenance with:
  - Entity-aware writing (auto detection)
  - Project Graph relationships
  - Coherence checks (voice/world/timeline)
  - Knowledge PR workflow for high-impact updates

---

### 2.3 Notion AI (Aug 2025 pricing shift)

**What changed**
- Notion publicly stated that **Notion AI is included with every Notion Business and Enterprise plan**.

**What their pricing page implies about product direction**
- Notion's Business tier explicitly emphasizes:
  - AI "Agent" behavior (multi-step tasks),
  - "Enterprise search" across connected apps,
  - "AI meeting notes," etc.
- Business is listed at **$20 per member/month**.

**How they position AI**
- AI is becoming a platform layer integrated into the workspace, not an on-demand "writer's tool."

**Weaknesses for creative writing**
- Notion optimizes for organizational throughput, not narrative flow.
- Creative canon consistency (voice, timeline, world facts) is not a native primitive.
- "Receipts" exist in some form, but not as a first-class governed artifact pipeline.

**Rhei counter-position**
- "Notion is the operating system for teams. Rhei is the operating system for long-form creative truth."

---

### 2.4 Obsidian

**What it is**
- A local-first, Markdown-based knowledge system with **graph view** and a large plugin ecosystem.

**Why writers use it despite no native AI**
- Local files: ownership + speed + offline resilience.
- Links/backlinks + graph: great for worldbuilding and idea webs.
- Plugins let users assemble their own workflow (including AI integrations if they want).

**How its graph compares to Rhei's Project Graph**
- Obsidian's graph is fundamentally **link-based** (documents/notes and their links).
- Rhei's Project Graph is (by design) **typed entities + relationships** with validation, approvals, and risk levels—closer to a domain model than a note graph.

**Rhei attack surface**
- Obsidian wins by *simplicity and control*. If Rhei feels heavy, Obsidian writers won't move.
- You must match:
  - speed,
  - offline feel (even if via caching),
  - keyboard-first navigation,
  - and provide a clear migration path.

## 3. Feature Gap Analysis Matrix

Top 5 chosen for direct product gravity on Rhei's core: **iA Writer, Scrivener, Sudowrite, NovelCrafter, Obsidian**.

| Capability | Rhei (target) | iA Writer | Scrivener | Sudowrite | NovelCrafter | Obsidian |
|------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Distraction-free writing | **Strong** (Flow Mode) | Strong | Medium | Weak-Medium | Medium | Medium |
| AI on-demand only | **Strong** | N/A | N/A | Weak | Medium | Plugin-dependent |
| Entity tracking | **Strong** (auto + graph) | None | Medium (manual) | Medium | **Strong** (Codex) | Weak-Medium |
| Long-form memory + governance | **Strong** (Living Memory + PRs) | None | Medium (manual) | Medium | Medium | Medium (manual) |
| Coherence checks | **Strong** (core bet) | Weak | Weak | Weak-Medium | Medium | Plugin-dependent |
| Real-time collaboration | **Strong** (Team tier) | Weak | Weak | Weak | Weak | Weak-Medium |
| Export options | Medium → **Strong** | Medium | **Strong** | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Provenance / receipts | **Strong** (manifest, citations) | None | Weak | Weak | Weak-Medium | Weak-Medium |

**Key gaps to close for migrations:**
- **Export parity** (Scrivener/Atticus expectations)
- **Speed + offline confidence** (Obsidian expectations)
- **Flow feel** (iA Writer expectations)

**Key differentiating advantages:**
- **Typed Project Graph + governance** (PRs, rollback, approvals)
- **Receipts by default** tied to artifacts
- **Coherence + silent proactivity** as a "compiler," not a chat toy

---

## 4. Positioning, USP, and Strategic Moat

### 4.1 USP Framing

You already have the right spine:
- **Intelligence on Invitation** (UX promise)
- **Living Model** (graph + memory + decisions)
- **Governed command-to-artifact automation** (widgets → artifacts → receipts)

A clean one-liner you can actually defend:

> **Rhei is a distraction-free writing environment that maintains a living model of your story—and produces governed, versioned deliverables with receipts.**

### 4.2 Blue Ocean Opportunities

1. **Receipts as a default primitive**
   Manifest + sources + staleness + "what changed" is rare in creative tools. This is your *trust moat*.

2. **Knowledge PRs for story truth**
   Reviewable changes to canon, entities, and relationships—more like "GitHub for project truth" than "AI writing assistant."

3. **Coherence as a compiler**
   Silent checks that surface as signals, not interruptions. This is writer-aligned and can expand to other personas later.

4. **Precedent learning tied to accepted outputs**
   "What worked last time" becomes an explicit influence trail.

### 4.3 Red Ocean Battles (Non-Negotiables)

These are boring, but mandatory:
- Best-in-class writing experience (latency, typography, focus mode)
- Exports that satisfy real workflows (DOCX/PDF, eventually ePub, manuscript compile)
- Organization primitives that don't fight the writer (outline, chapters/scenes, search)
- Cross-platform stability (web + macOS first is correct; mobile later)

### 4.4 Differentiation Hooks

- **"Write with focus. Summon intelligence."**
- **"Freedom with receipts."**
- **"The compiler for story truth."**
- **"Context-aware. Distraction-free. Governed by design."**

### 4.5 SWOT Analysis

**Strengths**
- Clear philosophical edge: on-demand AI, no interruptions
- Unique architecture: living model + approvals + rollback + receipts
- Technical leverage: Convex real-time + typed registries + Qdrant vectors

**Weaknesses**
- Risk of overbuilding "systems" before nailing the writing feel and exports
- Graph + governance can read as "complex" unless hidden behind calm UX
- Token economics only matter if outputs are consistently high quality

**Opportunities**
- Pull iA Writer users upward into "focus + intelligence"
- Convert Sudowrite users who feel overwhelmed by AI-forward workflows
- Own the "trust layer" narrative as AI adoption matures

**Threats**
- Notion can keep absorbing AI capabilities and reduce perceived need for specialized tools
- AI-first tools can improve context handling quickly; moat must be governance + receipts + coherence
- Obsidian's plugin ecosystem is a durable gravity well for power users

---

## 5. Pricing Intelligence

### Computable Token Economics

| Product | Price/mo | Published Allowance | $/1K tokens |
|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Rhei Pro** | **$14.99** | **500,000 tokens/mo** | **$0.03** |
| Sudowrite | $10-$44 | ~225K credits | ~$0.10 (credits ≠ tokens) |

### Not Computable (Bundle Pricing)

| Product | Price/mo | AI Packaging | Why $/token unclear |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Notion Business | $20/member | AI included | Bundled with platform value |
| ChatGPT Plus | $20 | Consumer sub | Quota-based, variable |
| Claude Pro | $20 | Consumer sub | Quota-based, model-dependent |

### Scenario-Based Comparison

If a subscription is $20/mo and you consume:
- **200K tokens/mo** → **$0.10 / 1K**
- **500K tokens/mo** → **$0.04 / 1K**
- **1M tokens/mo** → **$0.02 / 1K**

**Practical takeaway**: Rhei's economics are competitive for heavy usage *and* easier to reason about. The bigger pricing lever is not "cheaper tokens," it's **higher trust per token** (receipts, governance, coherence).

---

## 6. Strategic Roadmap: Writers First → Architects Later

### Phase 1 — Win the iA Writer Wedge

**Goal:** become the best place to write, period.

**Non-negotiables**
- Flow Mode that feels sacred (fast, beautiful, quiet)
- Cmd+K and slash commands as the only "AI surface"
- Baseline exports and formatting hygiene

**Differentiators (ship early)**
- Automatic entity detection → unobtrusive highlights → optional graph
- Coherence signals that appear *after* the writing moment (Pulse on exit)
- Widget pipeline with preview/confirm/apply + receipts

**Messaging**: "Same focus as iA Writer. With a living memory."

---

### Phase 2 — Living Memory OS for Long-Form Projects

**Goal:** move from "great editor" to "project truth system."

**Ship**
- Knowledge PR inbox (reviewable changes)
- Artifact manifests and staleness badges
- Decision ledger / canon pinning with citations

**Why it matters**: This is where you stop competing on UI polish alone and start competing on *trust*.

---

### Phase 3 — Teams and Professional Workflows

**Goal:** collaboration + governance for writing teams, agencies, studios.

**Ship**
- Permissioned collaboration and review workflows
- Proactivity engine (silent by default): background checks → Pulse signals → PR drafts

**Messaging**: "A calm writing environment that teams can trust."

---

### Phase 4 — Bridge to Technical/Architectural Workflows

This is where the "compiler" positioning becomes the bridge.

**The bridge value prop**
- Writers: "canon coherence"
- Architects: "spec coherence"
- Same engine, different facet.

**Concrete architect workflows (mapped to primitives)**
- **Project Graph** becomes a *system model*: services, APIs, dependencies, owners
- **Coherence** becomes: spec drift, contract mismatch, decision conflicts
- **Knowledge PRs** become: reviewable updates to ADRs, runbooks, architecture docs
- **Receipts** become: citations to code paths, commits, tickets

**Avoid the trap**: Do not try to out-Notion Notion. Your wedge is "truth maintenance with governance," not "workspace for everything."

---

## 7. What to Do Next (High Leverage)

1. **Pick your top migration target and build the conversion story**
   - iA Writer users: "flow + memory"
   - Sudowrite users: "control + coherence"
   - Obsidian users: "typed graph + receipts"

2. **Make exports a roadmap pillar, not a footnote**
   - If you want serious writers, you must respect publishing workflows

3. **Turn "Receipts by default" into a visible product moment**
   - Every meaningful output should show: *what it used, why it said it, what changed, and how to reproduce it*

4. **Keep the command palette sacred**
   - It is the behavioral contract that makes your philosophy believable

---

## Competitive Positioning by Audience

| Audience | Pain Point | Rhei Message |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Sudowrite users** | "AI is too present, distracting" | "Same AI power, but only when you ask" |
| **Scrivener users** | "Dated, no cloud, no AI" | "Modern Scrivener with AI and real-time sync" |
| **iA Writer fans** | "Love the focus, wish it had AI" | "Same focus, AI on demand" |
| **Notion writers** | "Not built for long-form" | "Purpose-built for creative writing" |
| **ChatGPT users** | "Have to re-explain my story every time" | "AI that remembers your whole story" |
| **Obsidian users** | "Scattered plugins, manual linking" | "Typed graph with governance built-in" |
