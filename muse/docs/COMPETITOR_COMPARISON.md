# Competitor Comparison

> Rhei vs writing tools and productivity apps (updated January 2026)
>
> Last competitive intel update: Notion AI tool architecture deep dive (Jan 2026)

---

## Executive Summary

1. **The writing market is split between "beautiful but dumb" and "powerful but chaotic."** Rhei's best strategic position is to own the third lane: *distraction-free canvas + structured story intelligence + governed outputs*. Your internal phrase "Freedom with receipts" is the right north star.

2. **AI-first tools win on ideation speed but lose on trust and control.** Their weakness is not model quality; it's UX (AI-forward), provenance (few receipts), and long-form governance (hard to keep canon coherent). Sudowrite's bundled "credits" model is especially vulnerable to a product that makes costs predictable and outputs reviewable.

3. **Codex-style tools (NovelCrafter) prove the demand for structured context, but the workflow is still "manual."** Rhei can replace "manual codex upkeep" with **automatic entity detection + Project Graph + Coherence**, while keeping the writing surface calm. NovelCrafter's pricing and feature set make this clear (Codex emphasis across plans).

4. **Notion is becoming an "AI platform for work," not a writing environment.** Their Business plan explicitly leans into AI agents, enterprise search, and meeting notes—excellent for teams, not optimized for long-form fiction flow.

5. **Obsidian's gravity is "local-first, link-first, plugin-first."** Writers accept its lack of native AI because it is fast, offline, and extensible. That is a warning: Rhei must be meaningfully better at *focus + structured memory + exports* to pull Obsidian writers over.

6. **Pricing clarity is a moat if you can keep it honest.** Rhei Pro at $14.99 for 500K tokens yields about **$0.03 per 1K tokens** (predictable). Many competitors do not publish token equivalents, making "value" feel fuzzy—an opportunity for Rhei to win with transparency.

7. **Craft proves "model tiering" beats "feature gating" for free users.** Craft offers AI to all users—free tier gets cheap models (LLaMA 3.2 1B/3B, GPT-5 Nano), paid tiers get better models. They gate *context features* (@ mentions) instead of AI itself. This creates better free-to-paid conversion because users experience value before paying.

## Rhei's Philosophy: "Intelligence on Invitation"

**Rhei is NOT another notes app. It's a context ingestion + focused writing system.**

Rhei occupies the unique quadrant: DISTRACTION-FREE + AI-CAPABLE
Craft is our closest competitor in this quadrant (but lacks story intelligence)
```

### Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Canvas is sacred** | Clean editor by default. No AI pop-ups, suggestions, or interruptions. |
| **Cmd+K summons power** | All AI accessed via command palette or slash commands. You invoke it. |
| **Context is automatic** | Entity detection runs silently. AI knows your characters without asking. |
| **Memory is persistent** | AI remembers across sessions, chapters, and projects. |
| **Writer owns the flow** | AI assists your vision. It never leads or overwrites without permission. |

### What Rhei IS

- A **context-aware writing environment** for creative writers
- A **distraction-free canvas** with AI that appears only when summoned
- A **story intelligence system** that tracks entities and relationships
- A **collaboration platform** for writing teams
- A **modern, cloud-native** alternative to legacy tools

### What Rhei is NOT

- NOT a notes app (Notion, Obsidian)
- NOT an AI that writes for you (Jasper, Copy.ai)
- NOT a legacy desktop app (Scrivener)
- NOT just a pretty editor (iA Writer)
- NOT an AI-first tool where AI is always suggesting (Sudowrite)

---

## 1. Market Segmentation Analysis

Below is the market as it actually behaves (not how companies describe themselves), and where Rhei can exploit weaknesses.

### Segment A — Minimalist Editors (iA Writer, Bear, Typora, Ulysses)

**Primary persona**
- Essayists, bloggers, journalists, "daily writers," and fiction writers who value *flow* above organization.

**Typical pricing**
- One-time purchase or low subscription; light feature sets; minimal infrastructure.

**What they do well**
- Calm typography, focus mode, speed, minimal UI.

**Structural weaknesses**
- **No structured memory** (characters, places, canon) without manual work.
- **No governance**: no receipts/provenance, no decision ledger.
- **No automation** beyond basic exports.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Steal this segment with a "modern iA Writer that *remembers*":
  - Flow Mode + typewriter + dimming (you already have this direction).
  - **On-demand** AI only (Cmd+K / slash).
  - Automatic entity detection + "quiet" Coherence signals (no popups).
  - "Receipts by default" for any non-trivial output (manifest + sources).

**Blunt truth**
- If Flow Mode doesn't feel world-class, iA Writer users won't care about your graph.

---

### Segment B — Novelist Tools (Scrivener, Atticus, Dabble)

**Primary persona**
- Serious long-form novelists and self-publishers; organization-heavy; "binder/corkboard" mental model.

**Typical pricing**
- One-time license or higher-priced subscriptions.

**What they do well**
- Long-form organization, compilation/export (especially for publishing workflows).

**Structural weaknesses**
- **Dated UX** (in many cases) and weak collaboration.
- **No AI-native governance** (no reviewable PRs, no provenance).
- Manual tracking of canon (character sheets, notes) doesn't scale cleanly.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Win with "cloud-native Scrivener" *without Scrivener complexity*:
  - Outline/binder parity is needed over time, but not first.
  - Deliver "compile-grade exports" (ePub/manuscript workflows) earlier than you'd like—this is table stakes in this segment.

---

### Segment C — AI-First Writing Tools (Sudowrite, NovelCrafter, Jasper)

**Primary persona**
- Fiction writers who want ideation, rewriting, and momentum; also some marketing/copy personas.

**Typical pricing**
- Subscription; often **metered** via credits/usage.
- Example: Sudowrite markets multiple paid tiers with monthly "credits."
- NovelCrafter is subscription-based with plans emphasizing AI writing + Codex, plus an enterprise tier.

**What they do well**
- Fast generation, brainstorming, and "unstuck" workflows.

**Structural weaknesses**
- **Control + trust gap**: it's easy for the tool to start "writing for you."
- **Canon drift**: long projects degrade without strong coherence systems.
- **Receipts are weak**: hard to justify *why* something is true.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Compete by reframing AI as *governed automation*:
  - Widgets → preview → confirm → apply (your spec nails this).
  - "Knowledge PRs" for graph/memory changes: reviewable, attributable, reversible.
  - Coherence system as a silent compiler: voice drift, world fact conflicts, timeline errors.

**Blunt truth**
- You don't beat these tools by "more generations." You beat them by "more correctness + more control."

---

### Segment D — General Productivity Platforms (Notion, Google Docs, Craft)

**Primary persona**
- Teams and knowledge workers; writing is *a means*, not the product.

**Typical pricing**
- Per-seat SaaS. Notion's published pricing shows Plus at $10 and Business at $20 per member/month.
- Craft: Free tier with AI (cheap models), Pro tiers for better models + context features.

**What they do well**
- Collaboration, flexible databases, integrations.
- Craft specifically: beautiful Apple-native UX, block-based editing, task management.

**Structural weaknesses (for creative writing)**
- UI becomes a management surface, not a writing surface.
- Structure is generic; long-form creative workflows are bolted on.
- AI is integrated as a broad capability, not writer-centric flow.
- **Craft-specific**: AI is read-only (cannot edit documents directly), no persistent memory across sessions, no entity tracking or story intelligence.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Position as: **"Notion for long-form creative work is a compromise. Rhei is purpose-built."**
- Still: you must match "good enough" collaboration and sharing.
- **Learn from Craft's model tiering**: consider offering free AI with cheap models rather than hard feature gates.

---

### Segment E — Screenwriting Tools (Final Draft, Arc Studio, Fade In)

**Primary persona**
- Screenwriters and production teams.

**Typical pricing**
- Often higher-priced, format-enforced tools.

**What they do well**
- Industry-standard formatting, collaboration/commenting in script workflows.

**Structural weaknesses**
- Less strong on "world model" and canon reasoning (unless manually maintained).
- AI is usually not deeply integrated with structured story intelligence.

**Rhei opportunity**
- Longer-term: treat screenplay as another "facet" of the same Living Model.
- Near-term: don't chase format compliance until the core writing + canon system is proven.

---

## 2. AI Writing Tools Deep Dive

### 2.1 Sudowrite ($10-22/mo)

**What it is**
- An AI-forward fiction writing tool with paid tiers and usage framed in "credits."

**How it handles context / memory**
- Strong at short-term context and feature-driven transformations (rewrite, expand, brainstorm).
- Long-form consistency typically relies on the user re-feeding context or using built-in story tools.

**Why users like it**
- Immediate ideation velocity.
- "Unstuck" workflows are the product.

**Where it's weak (Rhei attack surface)**
- **AI-forward presence**: it can feel like a machine in the room.
- **Governance gap**: it's not built as a reviewable "truth system" with provenance.
- **Economics opacity**: credits are not intuitive tokens; "how much can I do?" becomes cognitive overhead.

**Rhei counter-position**
- "Same creative acceleration, but with *control and receipts*."
- Your "preview → confirm → apply" pipeline is the wedge.
- Pair it with Coherence: "the tool catches drift before it becomes a rewrite nightmare."

---

### 2.2 NovelCrafter ($8-20/mo + Enterprise)

**What it is**
- A novelist-centric tool with strong Codex positioning and tiered plans.

**Notable feature signals (from pricing page)**
- **"Write with AI"** appears even in Standard.
- Codex is central: "Unlimited Codex Entries," plus Codex enhancements in higher tiers (highlights, detail lines, custom attributes).
- Higher tiers lean into customization and API access.

**Why it matters strategically**
- It validates that serious writers want a structured "world model," not just a prompt box.

**Where it's weak (Rhei attack surface)**
- Codex upkeep is still a *front-loaded cognitive tax*.
- A Codex is not the same as a **living model with governance**:
  - Not just "store facts," but "review changes," "link evidence," and "propagate impact."

**Rhei counter-position**
- Replace manual codex maintenance with:
  - Entity-aware writing (auto detection)
  - Project Graph relationships
  - Coherence checks (voice/world/timeline)
  - Knowledge PR workflow for high-impact updates

---

### 2.3 Notion AI (Aug 2025 pricing shift)

**What changed**
- Notion publicly stated that **Notion AI is included with every Notion Business and Enterprise plan**.

**What their pricing page implies about product direction**
- Notion's Business tier explicitly emphasizes:
  - AI "Agent" behavior (multi-step tasks),
  - "Enterprise search" across connected apps,
  - "AI meeting notes," etc.
- Business is listed at **$20 per member/month**.

**How they position AI**
- AI is becoming a platform layer integrated into the workspace, not an on-demand "writer's tool."

**Weaknesses for creative writing**
- Notion optimizes for organizational throughput, not narrative flow.
- Creative canon consistency (voice, timeline, world facts) is not a native primitive.
- "Receipts" exist in some form, but not as a first-class governed artifact pipeline.

**Rhei counter-position**
- "Notion is the operating system for teams. Rhei is the operating system for long-form creative truth."

---

### 2.4 Obsidian

**What it is**
- A local-first, Markdown-based knowledge system with **graph view** and a large plugin ecosystem.

**Why writers use it despite no native AI**
- Local files: ownership + speed + offline resilience.
- Links/backlinks + graph: great for worldbuilding and idea webs.
- Plugins let users assemble their own workflow (including AI integrations if they want).

**How its graph compares to Rhei's Project Graph**
- Obsidian's graph is fundamentally **link-based** (documents/notes and their links).
- Rhei's Project Graph is (by design) **typed entities + relationships** with validation, approvals, and risk levels—closer to a domain model than a note graph.

**Rhei attack surface**
- Obsidian wins by *simplicity and control*. If Rhei feels heavy, Obsidian writers won't move.
- You must match:
  - speed,
  - offline feel (even if via caching),
  - keyboard-first navigation,
  - and provide a clear migration path.

---

### 2.5 Craft (Free + Pro tiers)

**What it is**
- Apple-native document/notes app with block-based editing, task management, and AI assistant.
- Positions as a premium alternative to Notion for personal/small team use.

**AI Model Tiering (key insight)**

| Tier | Models Available | What's Gated |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **Core** (Free) | LLaMA 3.2 1B/3B, GPT-5 Nano | @ mentions, context features |
| **Fast** (Default) | Mid-tier models | — |
| **Max** (Premium) | Best models | — |

**Craft AI Tools (from direct interrogation)**

```
Document Navigation:
  list-documents, view-folder-structure, find-documents

Block Operations:
  blocks_get, blocks_get-content, blocks_get-table-of-contents
  blocks_get-parent-page-content, blocks_get-tasks
  document_find-blocks, document_get-comments

Task Management:
  space_list-tasks, space_list-calendar

Web Research:
  webSearchTool, webAskTool, webCrawlTool (all tiers!)

Media:
  imageResolutionTool, fileResolutionTool (PDFs, images)
```

**What Craft CAN do**
- Read and analyze documents, blocks, tasks
- Search across entire space
- Web research (search, crawl, ask)
- View images and PDFs
- Deep link to specific blocks (`craft://doc/{blockId}`)
- Suggest improvements wrapped in `<Content>` tags for easy copy

**What Craft CANNOT do**
- Create, edit, or delete content directly (read-only AI)
- Create tasks or todos
- Remember previous conversations (no persistent memory)
- Remember user between sessions
- Batch operations across documents
- Specialized analysis (readability scores, consistency checks)

**UX Pattern Worth Stealing: `<Content>` Tags**
Craft wraps AI-generated content meant for copying in `<Content>` tags:
```
Here's my suggestion:
<Content>
The dragon's scales shimmered like molten copper...
</Content>
This improves clarity because...
```
Clear signal for "copy this" vs "this is explanation."

**Why it matters strategically**

1. **Model tiering > feature gating**: Free users get AI → better activation → higher conversion.
2. **Context is the premium**: @ mentions (document context) are paid, not AI itself.
3. **Read-only is their choice**: Safety/control, but also a limitation we can exploit.
4. **Web search is free**: They don't gate research capabilities.
5. **No memory is a weakness**: "AI that remembers your story" is a clear differentiator.

**Rhei counter-position**
- "Craft AI reads your documents. Rhei AI *understands* your story."
- "Same AI assistance, but with persistent memory and story intelligence."
- "Craft suggests. Rhei detects, tracks, and maintains coherence."

**Rhei attack surface**
- No entity detection or tracking
- No consistency/coherence checking
- No persistent memory across sessions
- No governance/receipts for AI outputs
- Read-only (can't apply changes directly)

**What to steal from Craft**
1. **Model tiering for free tier** — offer AI with cheap models, not hard gates
2. **`<Content>` output convention** — clear UX for copyable content
3. **Deep linking to blocks** — `rhei://project/{id}/doc/{id}#block-{id}`
4. **Task reading tools** — AI should see existing todos/tasks
5. **Comment reading** — AI should see editorial feedback

## 3. Feature Gap Analysis Matrix

Top 7 chosen for direct product gravity on Rhei's core: **iA Writer, Scrivener, Sudowrite, NovelCrafter, Obsidian, Craft, Notion**.

| Capability | Rhei (target) | iA Writer | Scrivener | Sudowrite | NovelCrafter | Obsidian | Craft | Notion |
|------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Distraction-free writing | **Strong** (Flow Mode) | Strong | Medium | Weak-Medium | Medium | Medium | Strong | Weak |
| AI on-demand only | **Strong** | N/A | N/A | Weak | Medium | Plugin | **Strong** | Medium |
| Entity tracking | **Strong** (auto + graph) | None | Medium (manual) | Medium | **Strong** (Codex) | Weak-Medium | None | None |
| Long-form memory + governance | **Strong** (Living Memory + PRs) | None | Medium (manual) | Medium | Medium | Medium (manual) | None | None |

| Web research | **Strong** (Pro+) | None | None | None | None | Plugin | **Strong** | **Strong** |
| Task management | Weak (widgets) | None | Weak | None | None | Plugin | **Strong** | **Strong** |
| Free tier AI | Weak (20 calls) | N/A | N/A | None | None | Plugin | **Strong** | None |
| Deep linking | None → Medium | None | Weak | None | None | Medium | **Strong** | Medium (page only) |
| AI edits docs directly | **Strong** (TipTap blocks) | N/A | N/A | Medium | Medium | Plugin | None | **Strong** (find-replace) |
| Database queries | **Strong** (Convex) | None | None | None | None | Plugin | None | **Strong** (SQLite) |
| AI auto-execute | **Strong** | N/A | N/A | Medium | Medium | Plugin | None | **Strong** |

**Key gaps to close for migrations:**
- **Export parity** (Scrivener/Atticus expectations)
- **Speed + offline confidence** (Obsidian expectations)
- **Flow feel** (iA Writer expectations)
- **Free tier AI experience** (Craft expectations) — consider model tiering
- **Deep linking** (Craft/Obsidian expectations)
- **Task reading** (Craft expectations) — AI should see existing todos

**Key differentiating advantages:**
- **Typed Project Graph + governance** (PRs, rollback, approvals)
- **Receipts by default** tied to artifacts
- **Coherence + silent proactivity** as a "compiler," not a chat toy
- **Persistent memory** across sessions (vs Craft's session-only)
- **Specialized analysis tools** (clarity, consistency, logic checks)

---

## 4. Positioning, USP, and Strategic Moat

### 4.1 USP Framing

You already have the right spine:
- **Intelligence on Invitation** (UX promise)
- **Living Model** (graph + memory + decisions)
- **Governed command-to-artifact automation** (widgets → artifacts → receipts)

A clean one-liner you can actually defend:

> **Rhei is a distraction-free writing environment that maintains a living model of your story—and produces governed, versioned deliverables with receipts.**

### 4.2 Blue Ocean Opportunities

1. **Receipts as a default primitive**
   Manifest + sources + staleness + "what changed" is rare in creative tools. This is your *trust moat*.

2. **Knowledge PRs for story truth**
   Reviewable changes to canon, entities, and relationships—more like "GitHub for project truth" than "AI writing assistant."

3. **Coherence as a compiler**
   Silent checks that surface as signals, not interruptions. This is writer-aligned and can expand to other personas later.

4. **Precedent learning tied to accepted outputs**
   "What worked last time" becomes an explicit influence trail.

### 4.3 Red Ocean Battles (Non-Negotiables)

These are boring, but mandatory:
- Best-in-class writing experience (latency, typography, focus mode)
- Exports that satisfy real workflows (DOCX/PDF, eventually ePub, manuscript compile)
- Organization primitives that don't fight the writer (outline, chapters/scenes, search)
- Cross-platform stability (web + macOS first is correct; mobile later)

### 4.4 Differentiation Hooks

- **"Write with focus. Summon intelligence."**
- **"Freedom with receipts."**
- **"The compiler for story truth."**
- **"Context-aware. Distraction-free. Governed by design."**

### 4.5 SWOT Analysis

**Strengths**
- Clear philosophical edge: on-demand AI, no interruptions
- Unique architecture: living model + approvals + rollback + receipts
- Technical leverage: Convex real-time + typed registries + Qdrant vectors

**Weaknesses**
- Risk of overbuilding "systems" before nailing the writing feel and exports
- Graph + governance can read as "complex" unless hidden behind calm UX
- Token economics only matter if outputs are consistently high quality

**Opportunities**
- Pull iA Writer users upward into "focus + intelligence"
- Convert Sudowrite users who feel overwhelmed by AI-forward workflows
- Own the "trust layer" narrative as AI adoption matures

**Threats**
- Notion can keep absorbing AI capabilities and reduce perceived need for specialized tools
- AI-first tools can improve context handling quickly; moat must be governance + receipts + coherence
- Obsidian's plugin ecosystem is a durable gravity well for power users

---

## 5. Pricing Intelligence

### Computable Token Economics

| Product | Price/mo | Published Allowance | $/1K tokens |
|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Rhei Pro** | **$14.99** | **500,000 tokens/mo** | **$0.03** |
| Sudowrite | $10-$44 | ~225K credits | ~$0.10 (credits ≠ tokens) |

### Not Computable (Bundle Pricing)

| Product | Price/mo | AI Packaging | Why $/token unclear |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Notion Business | $20/member | AI included | Bundled with platform value |
| ChatGPT Plus | $20 | Consumer sub | Quota-based, variable |
| Claude Pro | $20 | Consumer sub | Quota-based, model-dependent |

### Scenario-Based Comparison

If a subscription is $20/mo and you consume:
- **200K tokens/mo** → **$0.10 / 1K**
- **500K tokens/mo** → **$0.04 / 1K**
- **1M tokens/mo** → **$0.02 / 1K**

**Practical takeaway**: Rhei's economics are competitive for heavy usage *and* easier to reason about. The bigger pricing lever is not "cheaper tokens," it's **higher trust per token** (receipts, governance, coherence).

---

## 6. Strategic Roadmap: Writers First → Architects Later

### Phase 1 — Win the iA Writer Wedge

**Goal:** become the best place to write, period.

**Non-negotiables**
- Flow Mode that feels sacred (fast, beautiful, quiet)
- Cmd+K and slash commands as the only "AI surface"
- Baseline exports and formatting hygiene

**Differentiators (ship early)**
- Automatic entity detection → unobtrusive highlights → optional graph
- Coherence signals that appear *after* the writing moment (Pulse on exit)
- Widget pipeline with preview/confirm/apply + receipts

**Messaging**: "Same focus as iA Writer. With a living memory."

---

### Phase 2 — Living Memory OS for Long-Form Projects

**Goal:** move from "great editor" to "project truth system."

**Ship**
- Knowledge PR inbox (reviewable changes)
- Artifact manifests and staleness badges
- Decision ledger / canon pinning with citations

**Why it matters**: This is where you stop competing on UI polish alone and start competing on *trust*.

---

### Phase 3 — Teams and Professional Workflows

**Goal:** collaboration + governance for writing teams, agencies, studios.

**Ship**
- Permissioned collaboration and review workflows
- Proactivity engine (silent by default): background checks → Pulse signals → PR drafts

**Messaging**: "A calm writing environment that teams can trust."

---

### Phase 4 — Bridge to Technical/Architectural Workflows

This is where the "compiler" positioning becomes the bridge.

**The bridge value prop**
- Writers: "canon coherence"
- Architects: "spec coherence"
- Same engine, different facet.

**Concrete architect workflows (mapped to primitives)**
- **Project Graph** becomes a *system model*: services, APIs, dependencies, owners
- **Coherence** becomes: spec drift, contract mismatch, decision conflicts
- **Knowledge PRs** become: reviewable updates to ADRs, runbooks, architecture docs
- **Receipts** become: citations to code paths, commits, tickets

**Avoid the trap**: Do not try to out-Notion Notion. Your wedge is "truth maintenance with governance," not "workspace for everything."

---

## 7. What to Do Next (High Leverage)

1. **Pick your top migration target and build the conversion story**
   - iA Writer users: "flow + memory"
   - Sudowrite users: "control + coherence"
   - Obsidian users: "typed graph + receipts"

2. **Make exports a roadmap pillar, not a footnote**
   - If you want serious writers, you must respect publishing workflows

3. **Turn "Receipts by default" into a visible product moment**
   - Every meaningful output should show: *what it used, why it said it, what changed, and how to reproduce it*

4. **Keep the command palette sacred**
   - It is the behavioral contract that makes your philosophy believable

---

## Competitive Positioning by Audience

| Audience | Pain Point | Rhei Message |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Sudowrite users** | "AI is too present, distracting" | "Same AI power, but only when you ask" |
| **Scrivener users** | "Dated, no cloud, no AI" | "Modern Scrivener with AI and real-time sync" |

## Appendix: Lessons from Craft AI

### A1. Model Tiering Strategy (Recommended)

Craft's approach to free tier AI:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CRAFT'S MODEL                                            │
│                                                          │
│  Free:  LLaMA 3.2 1B/3B, GPT-5 Nano  → Unlimited calls  │
│  Fast:  Mid-tier models               → Default          │
│  Max:   Best models (Claude, GPT-4o)  → Premium          │
│                                                          │
│  Gated: @ mentions (context), not AI itself              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this works:**
- Users experience AI value before paying → higher conversion
- Cheap models cost nearly nothing to serve
- Premium users pay for *quality*, not *access*

**Proposed Rhei adaptation:**
```typescript
// tierConfig.ts
free: {
  ai: {
    tokensPerMonth: null,  // unlimited (cheap models)
    callsPerDay: 100,      // generous
    models: [
      "meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct",
      "google/gemma-2-2b-it",
    ],
  },
  aiFeatures: {
    chat: true,
    webSearch: true,  // free with cheap models
    lint: false,      // pro feature
    coach: false,     // pro feature
  }
}
```

### A2. Output Format Convention

Craft uses `<Content>` tags to distinguish copyable content from explanation:

```markdown
I've analyzed your scene. Here are my suggestions:

<Content>
The dragon's scales shimmered like molten copper in the dying light.
Elena stepped back, her hand finding the hilt of her blade.
</Content>

This revision improves the pacing by...
```

**Rhei could adopt:**
- `<Content>` tags (same as Craft)
- `<CopyBlock>` tags (more explicit)
- Code blocks with `copyable` language hint
- UI treatment: highlighted box with copy button

### A3. Features to Implement

| Feature | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Model tiering for free | High | Medium | Planned |
| Deep linking to blocks | Medium | Medium | Partial (hash focus) |
| Task/todo reading | Medium | Low | Done (`agentTodos`) |
| `<Content>` output convention | Low | Low | Planned |
| Comment reading | Low | Low | Done (`view_comments` - agent + backend) |
| Comment writing | Low | Low | Done (`add_comment` - agent + backend, HITL) |
| Version history viewing | Medium | Low | Done (`view_version_history` - agent + backend) |
| Document deletion | Medium | Low | Done (`delete_document` - agent + backend, HITL/destructive) |
| User search for @mentions | Medium | Low | Done (`search_users` - agent + backend) |
| Thread summarization | Medium | Medium | Done (`summarizeThread` action + ChatUsageIndicator) |
| Batch PDF export | Low | Medium | Done (offscreen rendering with `batchRenderArtifacts()`) |

### A4. Missing UI for Collaboration Tools

| Component | Priority | Effort | Notes |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| `AddCommentApprovalCard` | P1 | 1-2 days | HITL approval in chat |
| `DeleteDocumentApprovalCard` | P1 | 1-2 days | Destructive warning styling |
| `VersionHistoryResultCard` | P1 | 2-3 days | Version list with diff preview |
| `CommentsResultCard` | P1 | 1-2 days | Comment list with author/timestamp |
| `UserSearchResultCard` | P1 | 1 day | @mention picker results |

**Total UI effort:** ~1 week for collaboration tool cards

## 2.6 Notion AI (Deep Dive - January 2026)

**What it is**
- AI assistant integrated into Notion workspace with full CRUD capabilities
- Uses auto-executing tools (no user confirmation required)
- 200k token context window per interaction
- No persistent memory across sessions

### Notion AI Tool Architecture

**Uses same XML syntax as Claude** (`antml:` namespace):
```xml
antml:invoke name="create-pages"
antml:parameter name="pages"
[{"properties": {"title": "My Page"}, "content": "..."}]
```

**Complete Tool List:**
```
Document Operations:
  view                  - View pages, databases, users, files, PDFs, images
  view-version-history  - Access version history (max 5 snapshots/call)
  create-pages          - Create new pages (batch up to 10)
  update-page-v2        - Update properties and content
  delete-pages          - Delete pages (batch supported)

Database Operations:
  create-database       - Create new databases (from schema, linked, or CSV)
  update-database       - Update database schemas and views
  query-data-sources    - Run SQLite queries (read-only, max 100 rows)

Search:
  search                - Internal, web, default (both), or user search

Social:
  send-notification     - Send in-app notifications
  get-page-discussions  - Get all discussions on a page
  add-comment-to-discussion - Add comments (cannot respond to existing)
```

**Hidden/Advanced Features:**
- Synced blocks (stay in sync across pages)
- Meeting notes blocks (AI transcripts)
- Table cell/row/column colors
- Inline databases (fully interactive)
- Place properties (lat/long, addresses)
- Custom workspace emoji
- Compressed URLs (INT format for token efficiency)

### Update Mechanism (update-page-v2)

**Schema:**
```json
{
  "pageUrl": "...",
  "command": "updateProperties" | "updateContent" | "replaceContent",

  // For updateContent:
  "contentUpdates": [
    {"oldStr": "exact text", "newStr": "replacement"},
    {"oldStr": "another match", "newStr": "another replacement"}
  ],

  // For replaceContent:
  "newStr": "completely new markdown content"
}
```

**Critical behaviors:**
- **ALL matches replaced** - if `oldStr` appears 3 times, all 3 replaced
- **View required first** - cannot update without viewing
- **No parallel updates** - must batch or serialize on same page
- **Array order matters** - contentUpdates applied sequentially

**Rhei comparison:** This find-and-replace is fragile. We have TipTap with block IDs for precise edits.

### Search Tool

**Four modes:**
| Mode | What it searches | Use case |
|------|------------------|----------|
| `internal` | Workspace + connected apps + helpdocs | Questions about your content |
| `web` | Web with category filters | Research |
| `default` | Internal + web combined | General questions |
| `users` | User directory by name/email | Finding people for @mentions |

**Web search categories:** research paper, news, company, pdf, github, tweet, linkedin profile, financial report

**Schema (web mode):**
```json
{
  "web": {
    "queries": ["Search query"],
    "category": "research paper",
    "includeDomains": ["arxiv.org", "nature.com"],
    "includeText": ["must contain"],
    "excludeText": ["must not contain"]
  }
}
```

**Rhei comparison:** Category filters are interesting. We could add similar filtering to our web search tool.

### SQLite Database Queries

**This is the most interesting capability.**

```json
{
  "mode": "sql",
  "dataSourceUrls": ["database-uuid"],
  "query": "SELECT * FROM \"database-uuid\" WHERE \"Status\" = ? AND \"Due Date\" < ?",
  "params": ["In Progress", "2026-01-20"]
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- Read-only SELECT queries only
- JOINs across multiple databases
- `json_each()` for relation fields
- Parameterized queries for safety
- Max 100 rows per query

**Example JOIN:**
```sql
SELECT o.*, t."Team Name"
FROM "tasks-uuid" o
JOIN "users-uuid" t
ON t.url IN (SELECT value FROM json_each(o."Assignee"))
```

**Rhei comparison:** We have Convex which is more powerful (full CRUD, reactive, typed). But exposing SQL-like query to AI for read operations is interesting.

### Block Structure (create-pages)

Notion uses markdown + XML for advanced blocks:

```markdown
**Bold text** and *italic*

> Blockquote with {color="blue_bg"}

<callout icon="⚠️" color="yellow_bg">
**Important:** Deadline is Friday
</callout>

▶ Click to expand toggle
	Content inside toggle (tab-indented)

<columns>
	<column>Column 1</column>
	<column>Column 2</column>
</columns>

- [ ] Todo item
- [x] Completed todo

$E = mc^2$  <!-- LaTeX -->
```

**Nesting:** Tab indentation determines parent-child relationships.

**Rhei comparison:** Our TipTap editor handles this natively with proper block structure.

### View Tool

**Viewable entity types:**
- Pages, databases, data sources, views
- Users (`user://uuid`)
- Files, images, PDFs (`file://...`)
- Version snapshots (max 5 per call)
- Discussions, Slack messages
- Raw web URLs
- Formula results

**Limitations:**
- No direct block ID viewing - whole page only
- Large pages loaded in full within token limits

### Citations & Mentions

**Mention types:**
```markdown
<mention-user url="user://uuid">Name</mention-user>
<mention-page url="https://notion.so/...">Page title</mention-page>
<mention-database url="uuid">Database name</mention-database>
<mention-data-source url="uuid">Data source</mention-data-source>
<mention-date start="2026-01-14" end="2026-01-20"/>
```

**Citations:** `Some fact.[^URL]`

**Critical limitation:** NO block-level deep links. Only page/database/data source level.

**Rhei advantage:** We can implement `rhei://project/{id}/doc/{id}#block-{id}` for true block-level linking.

### Multimodal Capabilities

**Can do:**
- View and analyze images (OCR, object detection)
- View and extract from PDFs
- Create tables (HTML-like syntax)
- Create equations (LaTeX)
- Create code blocks with syntax highlighting

**Cannot do:**
- Generate images
- Create Mermaid diagrams or other diagram DSLs
- Native chart generation

### Workflow Patterns

**Standard "improve document" flow:**
1. `view` - Load the page content (required)
2. `update-page-v2` - Batch all changes in one call

**Best practice:** 1-5 contentUpdates per call, batch related changes.

### Context & Memory Architecture (Confirmed Jan 2026)

**Token Budget:**
- 200k token context window total
- **Individual pages truncated at ~26,060 tokens** (important limitation!)
- AI can see total budget but NOT remaining tokens (no real-time counter)
- No automatic summarization or context management
- No warnings when context is running low
- Conversation hits limit → user must start new chat manually

**Session Persistence:**
- **No memory across sessions** - each chat starts fresh
- One workaround: **Instruction pages** (user-created persistent instructions)
- "Click on my face in this chat" to set up instruction page
- Similar to our CLAUDE.md pattern

**Activation Model:**
- **Purely reactive** - never activates proactively
- Cannot run background tasks
- Cannot monitor workspace for changes
- No agent triggers (coming in future, not available now)

**@ Mention Behavior:**
- Loads full page content into context
- Limited by 200k token budget
- Too many large mentions → context overflow

### What Notion AI CANNOT Do

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| No persistent memory | User must re-explain context each session |
| No block-level deep links | Can't cite specific paragraphs |
| **Page truncation at ~26k tokens** | Long documents silently cut off |
| No real-time token counter | Can't warn user before context overflow |
| No auto-summarization | Context hits 200k → conversation dies |
| No proactive suggestions | Purely reactive, no background processing |
| No templates management | Can't create or modify templates |
| No sharing/permissions | Can't manage access |
| No automations | Can't create or trigger workflows |
| No image generation | Text-only output |
| No diagram DSLs | No Mermaid, Graphviz, etc. |
| Read-only SQL | Can query but not modify via SQL |

### Vector Search (Confirmed)

Notion uses **semantic search** with vector embeddings:
- Natural language questions → LLM converts to structured query
- Finds conceptually similar content, not just keyword matches
- Example: "tasks due soon" finds pages mentioning "upcoming deadlines"
- Vector DB implied but not directly accessible to AI

### Intelligence Capabilities (NOT Dumb!)

Notion AI can do genuine analysis, not just tool wrapping:

| Capability | How It Works |
|------------|--------------|
| **Word counting** | Views content, counts accurately |
| **Duplicate detection** | Views multiple pages, compares content |
| **Database inconsistencies** | SQL queries to find illogical data |
| **Schema suggestions** | Analyzes data patterns, recommends improvements |
| **Writing style analysis** | Evaluates tone, structure, vocabulary |
| **Multi-step reasoning** | Chains: search → view → analyze → update |
| **Theme synthesis** | Reviews multiple pages, identifies connections |
| **Workload analysis** | Queries tasks, evaluates feasibility |

**Constraints on intelligence:**
- Max 2 search attempts for same info
- Must use gender-neutral language when gender unknown
- Prefers updating blank pages over creating subpages
- Cannot output `<content>` tags when replacing text
- No meta-commentary aimed at user in page content

### Connected Apps (Integrations)

When configured, Notion AI can search and view content from:
- Slack, Microsoft Teams
- Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive
- GitHub, Linear, Asana, Jira
- Gmail, Notion Mail

Can view full content (e.g., Slack messages, Gmail threads) and cite specific items.

### Patterns to Steal

1. **View-before-update safety** - Require reading content before editing
2. **Batch updates** - Multiple changes in single operation
3. **SQLite for graph queries** - Interesting approach to structured queries
4. **Web search categories** - Category filters for research
5. **User search for @mentions** - Dedicated tool for finding people
6. **XML block syntax** - Clear syntax for advanced blocks
7. **Instruction pages** - User-created persistent instructions (like CLAUDE.md)
8. **Semantic search** - Vector-based with LLM query expansion
9. **Compressed URL format** - INT references to save tokens
10. **Synced blocks** - Content that stays in sync across documents
11. **Connected app search** - Search across Slack, GitHub, Gmail, etc.
12. **Batch page creation** - Up to 10 pages per call
13. **Place properties** - Lat/long + address support

### Patterns to Beat

| Notion Pattern | Rhei Advantage |
|----------------|----------------|
| Find-and-replace updates (fragile) | TipTap block IDs for precise edits |
| Page-level links only | Block-level deep links (`#block-{id}`) |
| No persistent memory | Living Memory + entity tracking |
| No context warnings | Token usage indicator + auto-summarization |
| Purely reactive | Proactive coherence checks (background) |
| Session-scoped context | Cross-session coherence |
| Generic productivity AI | **Story-specialized** intelligence |
| No real-time token counter | Context budget visibility to AI |
| Manual "instruction pages" | Automatic project context (CLAUDE.md) |
| **Page truncation at 26k tokens** | Smart chunking + summarization for long docs |
| **No entity detection** | Auto-detect characters, places, items |
| **No relationship tracking** | Project Graph with typed relationships |
| **No coherence checking** | Voice, timeline, world-fact validation |
| **Cannot edit same page in parallel** | Concurrent block-level edits |
| **Cannot respond to comments** | Full discussion participation |

### Rhei Counter-Position

- "Notion AI helps you write documents. Rhei AI *understands* your story."
- "Notion forgets you every session. Rhei remembers your characters, plot, and canon."
- "Notion links to pages. Rhei links to specific sentences."
- "Notion waits until you ask. Rhei quietly checks coherence in the background."
- "Notion's context dies at 200k. Rhei summarizes and continues."
- "Notion's find-and-replace is fragile. Rhei edits by block ID."
- "Notion silently truncates your novel at 26k tokens. Rhei reads the whole thing."
