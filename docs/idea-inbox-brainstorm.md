# Idea Inbox Brainstorm

Practical writing techniques and product guidance for a clean, seamless, and effortless Idea Inbox. This supports low-pressure creativity while staying tied to project context.

## Tracking
- bd: saga-ujs (external ref muse-gk6.11)

## North Star
- Capture-first, zero friction.
- Process later, never required.
- Calm, readable, and quiet by default.
- Always anchored to a project, with an optional All Projects view.

## Writing Techniques (Low Pressure)
- Shitty first draft: deliberately write the worst version to break perfectionism.
- Freewrite sprints: 3-10 minutes, no stopping, no editing.
- Seed notes: capture a phrase, image, or question only.
- Braindump list: fragments in a list, no full sentences needed.
- "What if" chain: 5-10 variations from a single prompt.
- Scene sketch: who/where/feeling only, no plot.
- Voice sampling: one paragraph in a different tense or tone.
- Contrast pairs: note two opposites and let them collide.
- Constraint prompt: 100 words or one sense to sharpen focus.
- Tag later: postpone labels until processing time.

## Experience Principles (Notion-clean)
- One primary action: "Drop a thought..."
- Avoid busy UI: minimal chrome, generous spacing.
- Hide metadata by default: show on long-press or details view.
- Keep transitions soft: fast, but not flashy.
- No forced decisions: "You can come back later."

## Project-First Flow
- Default to active project inbox.
- Show project name in the header and capture placeholder.
- Quick switch for project context if needed.
- Allow "All Projects" only as a secondary view.

## Capture Flow (Mobile and Web)
1. Open inbox for the active project.
2. Type a fragment or note.
3. Save instantly with no extra fields.
4. Optional: one-tap "Freewrite" for a larger input.

## Processing Flow
- Two states: Inbox (unprocessed) and Processed.
- Archive stays available, but is not a primary action.
- Actions are lightweight: swipe on mobile, hover on web.

## Suggested Microcopy
- Placeholder: "Drop a thought..."
- Helper: "No pressure. Fragments welcome."
- Empty state: "Start with a seed. You can shape it later."
- Processing hint: "Process when ready, not now."

## Optional Enhancements (Later)
- Full Inbox view for long lists.
- Quick capture from project header.
- Daily prompt for gentle nudges, never required.
